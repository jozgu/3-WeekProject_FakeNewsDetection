Could not be scraped,"Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Sunday reiterated that Russia would face “massive consequences” if it invaded Ukraine again and said this week’s negotiations will test whether Russian President Vladimir Putin is willing to resolve the crisis diplomatically.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightU.S. and Russian delegations will meet for talks in Geneva on Monday, followed by a meeting of the NATO-Russia Council in Brussels on Wednesday and a session of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in Vienna on Thursday. The meetings come amid rising tensions over a Russian troop buildup on the border with Ukraine.“It’s clear that we’ve offered him two paths forward,” Blinken said of Putin on ABC News’s “This Week” on Sunday. “One is through diplomacy and dialogue; the other is through deterrence and massive consequences for Russia if it renews its aggression against Ukraine. And we’re about to test the proposition of which path President Putin wants to take this week.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementIn a phone call with President Biden last month — their second in a month — Putin warned that any new sanctions on Moscow could result in “a complete rupture of relations” between their countries. Putin has demanded that the United States and NATO agree to sweeping security guarantees that would bar Ukraine from joining NATO and rule out any eastward expansion by the U.S.-led military alliance.Blinken on Sunday reiterated that there would be economic, financial and other consequences for Moscow if it “renews its aggression” against Ukraine — including an expanded NATO presence on the eastern flank near Russia. The United States has also been providing “significant defensive assistance” to Ukraine, as recently as the last couple of weeks, Blinken added.Russia’s rifts with the West keep growing. How did we get here?“How we got here is because Russia has committed repeated acts of aggression against its neighbors going back more than a decade: Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine in 2014, and now the prospect of doing that again,” Blinken said, echoing remarks from Friday in which he blasted Putin’s insistence that NATO is threatening Russia as a false narrative.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“That’s like the fox saying it had to attack the henhouse because its occupants somehow pose a threat,” Blinken said then. “We’ve seen this gaslighting before.”On Sunday, the secretary of state said that any “breakthroughs” in the discussions this week are unlikely and that any progress would have to happen on a reciprocal basis.“If the United States and Europe are taking steps to address some of Russia’s concerns, Russia will have to do the same thing,” Blinken told CNN’s “State of the Union.”“Second, nothing’s happening without Europe,” he added. “And third, it’s hard to see making actual progress as opposed to talking in an atmosphere of escalation with a gun to Ukraine’s head. So if we’re actually going to make progress, we’re going to have to see de-escalation — Russia pulling back from the threat that it currently poses to Ukraine.”In early December, U.S. intelligence agencies warned that Russia was planning a massive military invasion of Ukraine. Here’s why Moscow would do that. (Jason Aldag/The Washington Post)In comments to Russian media on Sunday, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov, the Kremlin’s top negotiator for the talks, also tamped down expectations about this week’s meetings. He told Russian state news agency RIA on Sunday that Moscow is not going into the talks with an “outstretched hand” and might not see the need to continue the discussions past Monday.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“If we walk in circles and repeat the same thing, if we do not see the slightest signs of readiness from the other side to take into account our priorities, to react to them in a constructive way, then the dialogue will become pointless,” he said. “And what is the point in continuing it?”Current and former U.S. officials have spoken highly of Ryabkov. Michael McFaul, the U.S. ambassador to Russia from 2012 to 2014, said Ryabkov is “one of the best diplomats Russia has.”Ryabkov told the Russian news agency Interfax on Sunday that Moscow’s “expectations are realistic.”Russian escalation overshadows prospects for resolving Ukraine crisis, Blinken says“Based on the signals that have been voiced by Washington and Brussels in recent days, it would probably be naive to assume any progress, especially a rapid one,” he said. “This is definitely an alarming moment, because the task before us is to reach an agreement swiftly, without any pauses. Without giving our U.S. and NATO colleagues a chance to slow it all down and involve us in endless discussions on the same topics.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementBlinken on Sunday also said he had spoken to his counterpart in Kazakhstan, after days of violence and bloodshed amid sweeping anti-government demonstrations, and that the United States had questions about why the Kazakh government called in forces from a Russia-led military alliance.“We have real concerns about the state of emergency that was declared in Kazakhstan,” Blinken said on ABC News. “Kazakhstan has the ability to maintain law and order, to defend the institutions of the state, but to do so in a way that respects the rights of peaceful protesters and also addresses the concerns that they’ve raised — economic concerns, some political concerns.”Robyn Dixon, Paul Sonne, John Hudson and Ellen Nakashima contributed to this report.Read more:U.S. plans to discuss missile deployments with Russia as part of effort to defuse Ukraine crisisTrump’s Cable Cabinet: New texts reveal the influence of Fox hosts on previous White HouseSen.

Could not be scraped,"Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) has announced he will seek reelection for a third term this year, despite a previous pledge to retire, saying he believes “the country is in too much peril” for him to leave after his second term.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightIn an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal on Sunday, Johnson, a staunch ally of former president Donald Trump, explained that he had not anticipated that Democrats would take over the government in 2020.“As I have told crowds since my first Tea Party speeches in 2010: This is a fight for freedom. This is not someone else’s fight, this is our fight, and it’s a fight we absolutely must win,” Johnson wrote. “I believe America is in peril. Much as I’d like to ease into a quiet retirement, I don’t feel I should.”Story continues below advertisementHe added that “countless people” have encouraged him to run.AdvertisementJohnson, 66, had promised in 2016 when he ran for his second term that he would retire at the end of it if he won. Earlier this year, the senator waffled on that promise, telling reporters that he had not decided yet whether to run for a third term.Johnson has become known for his embrace of outlandish conspiracy theories, particularly about the 2020 election and the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. He voted against confirming Joe Biden’s electoral college win and supported an audit of the election results in Wisconsin, which the Democrat flipped in 2020.Johnson has also played down the storming of the Capitol by a pro-Trump mob seeking to stop the counting of the electoral votes, a siege that resulted in five deaths and left about 140 members of law enforcement injured. The senator drew outrage in February for claiming that the Capitol riot “didn’t seem like an armed insurrection to me” but has since doubled down on his stance that Democrats have exaggerated the events of that day.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAbout a month later, Johnson faced calls from Democrats to resign after he said he “never felt threatened” by the pro-Trump mob on Jan. 6, but might have had it been Black Lives Matter protesters.At the time, Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) said Johnson’s remarks were “seriously embarrassing” to Wisconsin.“We’ve moved from just plain old fringe, extremist rants to fringe extremist and racist rants,” Pocan tweeted then.Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) has been misconstruing data to support false allegations of violence related to Black Lives Matter and antifa in the summer of 2020. (Adriana Usero/The Washington Post)Johnson has also railed against coronavirus mandates, questioned the effectiveness of vaccines, and promoted unproven treatments for covid-19, to the point of getting temporarily banned from certain social media platforms.In June, YouTube suspended Johnson for a week after he shared a clip touting the supposed benefits of hydroxychloroquine in fighting covid-19. At a town hall last month, Johnson recommended gargling mouthwash as an effective treatment for the coronavirus, prompting Listerine to publicly state that it is “not clinically proven to kill the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.”",0,WashingtonPost
Could not be scraped,"Stephanie Grisham, former press secretary to President Donald Trump, remembers the challenges that came from so many Fox News hosts having the direct number to reach Trump in the White House residence.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRight“There were times the president would come down the next morning and say, ‘Well, Sean thinks we should do this,’ or, ‘Judge Jeanine thinks we should do this,’ ” said Grisham, referring to Sean Hannity and Jeanine Pirro, both of whom host prime-time Fox News shows. Grisham — who resigned from the White House amid the Jan. 6 attacks and has since written a book critical of Trump — said West Wing staffers would simply roll their eyes in frustration as they scrambled to respond to the influence of the network’s hosts, who weighed in on everything from personnel to messaging strategy.Story continues below advertisementTrump’s staff, allies and even adversaries were long accustomed to playing to an “Audience of One” — a commander in chief with a twitchy TiVo finger and obsessed with cable news.AdvertisementBut text messages — newly released by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection — between Fox News hosts and former Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows, crystallize with new specificity just how tightly Fox News and the White House were entwined during the Trump years, with many of the network’s top hosts serving as a cable cabinet of unofficial advisers.As the Jan. 6 attacks on the U.S. Capitol unfolded, Meadows received texts from Fox News hosts Laura Ingraham and Brian Kilmeade, as well as Hannity, according to the newly released communications.Story continues below advertisement“Mark, the president needs to tell people in the Capitol to go home,” Ingraham wrote. “This is hurting all of us. He is destroying his legacy.” Ingraham’s private missives, however, differed starkly from what she said on her show later that evening, when she began whitewashing the violence of the day and claiming the attacks were “antithetical” to the Trump movement.AdvertisementKilmeade urged Meadows to get Trump “on TV” to call off the rioters, writing, “Destroying everything you have accomplished.”And Hannity asked Meadows, “Can he make a statement? Ask people to leave the Capitol.”In private text messages on Jan. 6, Fox News hosts condemned President Trump’s response to the attack. In public, those same hosts deflected blame from Trump. (JM Rieger/The Washington Post)‘Everyone tunes in’: Inside Trump’s obsession with cable TVOther texts released by the committee reveal that Hannity also offered the White House advice in the run-up and aftermath to the attacks that resulted in five deaths. On Dec. 31, 2020, Hannity texted Meadows to warn, “I do NOT see January 6 happening the way he is being told.” And on Jan. 10, 2021 — referring to a conversation he had with Trump himself — Hannity texted Meadows and Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), a close Trump ally, to try to discuss strategies to rein in Trump.“Guys, we have a clear path to land the plane in 9 days,” Hannity wrote. “He can’t mention the election again. Ever. I did not have a good call with him today. And worse, I’m not sure what is left to do or say, and I don’t like not knowing if it’s truly understood. Ideas?”A former senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share candid details of private discussions, said Trump would also sometimes dial Hannity and Lou Dobbs — whose Fox Business show was canceled in February — into Oval Office staff meetings.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“A lot of it was PR — what he should be saying and how he should be saying it; he should be going harder against wearing masks or whatever,” Grisham said. “And they all have different opinions, too.”A Trump spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Fox News declined to comment.Michael Pillsbury, an informal Trump adviser, said he realized how powerful Fox News was in Trump’s orbit when the former president began embracing Sidney Powell — an attorney promoting Trump’s false claims of widespread voter fraud — and other election fabulists after seeing them on Dobbs’s show. Pillsbury added that while it seemed obvious that many of the claims were patently false, Trump was inclined to believe them, in part because he was watching them on TV and had affection for Dobbs in particular.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“It taught me the power of the young producers at Fox, and Fox Business especially,” Pillsbury said. “These young producers who are in their mid-20s. They come out of the conservative movement, they‘ve never been in the government. They are presented with these reckless, fantastical accounts. And they believe them and put them on for ratings.”Alyssa Farah, a former White House communications director, said the four most influential Fox hosts were Dobbs, Hannity, Igraham, and Pirro — and in the final year of the Trump administration, Hannity was the most influential. Other former top administration officials also mentioned Mark Levin, another Fox News host, and Maria Bartiromo, a Fox Business host, as two other network stars in regular touch with the White House.From the point of view of the staff, Farah said, the goal was simply to “try to get ahead of what advice you thought he was going to be given by these people” because their unofficial counsel “could completely change his mind on something.”Fox News hosts urged Trump to stop Jan. 6 violence, texts showBut the relationship was also symbiotic, with White House aides actively trying to influence the network, especially on issues such as spending deals and averting government shutdowns. They knew if they could get Fox hosts to echo their goals on air, that would help sway the president.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementJeff Cohen, author of “Cable News Confidential: My Misadventures in Corporate Media,” said the recent text messages represent a “smoking gun.”“If you watch Fox News as much as I do, and I watch a few hours a night, they’re always signaling their close contact with the White House,” Cohen said referring to the Trump era. “But these texts are just the hard evidence. This is just how deeply intertwined the Fox News leadership is with Trump and the Trump White House.”The problem, he explained, is that even though many of these hosts are opinion journalists, they are still violating public trust by not disclosing the full extent of their relationships with the Trump administration.“Journalists and media are supposed to be public checks on power, not private advisers to power,” Cohen said. “A commentator is still a journalist, and even if the commentator doesn’t consider him or herself to be a journalist, they still have to tell the public when they played a role in something they’re commenting on.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementOne former top White House official said that the hosts often had more influence with Trump based on what they said on air rather than in their various backchannels to him and his team, in part because the former president was obsessed with the following — and ratings — of their shows.Former Trump chief of staff John F. Kelly told others in the White House that Dobbs’s show was critical to understanding the president and that Trump’s ideas and feelings about people often originated from that program. Kelly also told colleagues that if Dobbs went after a White House senior staffer, they risked their status falling quickly in the eyes of the former president.When Kelly could not watch the prime-time Fox shows himself, he would ask other staffers to monitor them, and he would scour the White House call logs for the names of Fox News personalities.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementPirro, several Trump aides said, often became irate if the former president did not appear on her show frequently enough in her view, especially if he had been on Hannity’s show several times prior.Fox shows were so important to the president that White House staffers were determined to get guests booked on them, even forcing staffers to take weekend shifts appearing on Pirro’s show after Pirro complained she couldn’t get a guest — and the former president also called in himself.During the 2020 presidential campaign, Hannity called Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel and other Trump allies on a number of occasions to voice his months-long concern that the campaign was heading in the wrong direction and Trump would lose unless he turned around his operation, according to a Republican with direct knowledge of the campaign’s operations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share details of private discussions. They added that Hannity was much more bullish on his show than in private about Trump’s electoral prospects.Analysis: Sean Hannity’s Jan. 6 texts and the duplicity they reinforceAs the coronavirus pandemic ramped up in early 2020, a range of Fox News hosts again mobilized to offer backchannel advice to the Trump White House. In March, Tucker Carlson flew to Trump’s private Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Fla., to warn of the seriousness of the virus. Carlson told Trump he might lose the election because of covid-19, while Trump told the prime-time host that the virus wasn’t as deadly as people were claiming. AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementIn April, Ingraham arrived at the White House with two on-air regulars who are part of what she describes as her “medicine cabinet” for a private meeting with Trump. There, she talked up hydroxychloroquine, a controversial anti-malarial drug which public health experts have concluded is not effective as a covid-19 treatment.An internal Trump coronavirus response team led by Jared Kushner, the former president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, also prioritized the requests of certain VIPs, including Kilmeade and Pirro. Kilmeade had called two administration officials, for instance, to pass along tips about where to obtain personal protective equipment. And Pirro had repeatedly urged administration officials to send a large quantity of masks to a specific New York hospital.At the time, a Fox News spokeswoman said neither host had been aware that their tips were receiving preferential treatment.Since leaving office, Trump has vociferously complained about Fox, particularly its coverage of the election and what he views as increasingly negative coverage about him. But he has kept in close touch with many of the hosts and even sees some of them at his Florida resort.The Jan. 6 committee has asked Hannity to cooperate with its investigation, and he has hired Jay Sekulow, a longtime Trump attorney, to represent him. “We are evaluating the letter from the committee. We remain very concerned about the constitutional implications especially as it relates to the First Amendment. We will respond as appropriate,” Sekulow said in a statement last week.But some former senior White House officials said the texts make the role of Hannity and others seem more outsize than it was. The former president appreciated that the Fox crew was fighting on his behalf on a daily basis, this person said, “but he would not be like, ‘Let me call Larry Kudlow and change our economic plan because Laura Ingraham said that.’ ”Of course, Kudlow, who now hosts a show on Fox Business, came to Trump’s attention as a top economic adviser in part because of the business show he previously hosted on CNBC.",0,WashingtonPost

Cruz said he had frequently described attacking police — as many Capitol rioters did — as terrorism, and that’s all he meant here.Story continues below advertisementLet’s set aside for the moment that Cruz’s previous comments invoking the word “terrorism” drew no such distinction; he used the phrase “terrorist attack” quite broadly to describe Jan. 6, in fact, just as he did Wednesday.AdvertisementWhat he described as the one actual example of terrorism doesn’t really fit — even as the attack could legally qualify as terrorism for a number of other reasons.A week after Jan. 6, and shortly after Cruz labeled the attack terrorism repeatedly, the Congressional Research Service issued a report on whether the rioters might have been engaged in terrorism. It cited two definitions:The Code of Federal Regulations: “The unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives.”The federal criminal code’s definition: “Acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State” that “appear to be intended … to intimidate or coerce a civilian population … to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion … or to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and … occur primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.”The CRS report is uncharacteristically definitive on this point, saying, “The participants’ actions seem to fit both definitions.” And they do. This was clearly intended to influence the work of a government using intimidation or coercion.

But it’s also a straw man, because strictly speaking, domestic terrorism isn’t a chargeable crime — at least not by itself.

In other cases, prosecutors seem to have dropped the enhancement, in exchange for cooperation from particular defendants.As Reuters reporter Brad Heath noted shortly after the Carlson-Cruz interview, despite the lack of attempts to increase sentences using the terrorism sentencing boost, prosecutors have used the word in more than 150 cases.Interestingly, as Gerstein noted in his prescient piece, the government has specified 57 crimes that can trigger a lengthier sentence if they qualify as domestic terrorism.

It cited two definitions:The Code of Federal Regulations: “The unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives.”The federal criminal code’s definition: “Acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State” that “appear to be intended … to intimidate or coerce a civilian population … to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion … or to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and … occur primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.”The CRS report is uncharacteristically definitive on this point, saying, “The participants’ actions seem to fit both definitions.” And they do. This was clearly intended to influence the work of a government using intimidation or coercion. It’s difficult to understand it as anything else.Story continues below advertisementWhere things get a little hairier — and where the conversation Thursday night on Fox News devolved — is when it comes to actual criminal charges involving terrorism.Advertisement“How many people have been charged with terrorism on January 6th?” Carlson asked Cruz. “Like, why did you use that word?”And the thing is, he’s kind of right: Nobody has been charged with terrorism for their Jan. 6 actions. But it’s also a straw man, because strictly speaking, domestic terrorism isn’t a chargeable crime — at least not by itself. Instead, it’s something that can be used to increase sentences for other crimes.Just a day before Cruz’s comments set the MAGA movement off, Politico’s Josh Gerstein dived into this question:Story continues below advertisementSeeking to satisfy a large swath of the public outraged by the Jan. 6 riot, prosecutors have declared that the event “certainly” qualifies as domestic terrorism. But they’ve kept their powder dry thus far on invoking the terrorism sentencing boost — potentially because its impact can be so severe....Invoking the terrorism enhancement typically adds about 15 years in prison to a defendant’s recommended sentence, sets the minimum calculation at 17 and a half years, and also flips the person charged into the criminal-history category used for serial offenders.While prosecutors have yet to actually call for the enhancement at a sentencing for a Capitol riot defendant, the terrorism-related provision is playing a significant role behind the scenes.At pretrial hearings, defense attorneys have indicated that they were unwilling to consider plea deals for their clients because prosecutors would not agree to refrain from seeking the domestic terrorism charges. In other cases, prosecutors seem to have dropped the enhancement, in exchange for cooperation from particular defendants.As Reuters reporter Brad Heath noted shortly after the Carlson-Cruz interview, despite the lack of attempts to increase sentences using the terrorism sentencing boost, prosecutors have used the word in more than 150 cases.Interestingly, as Gerstein noted in his prescient piece, the government has specified 57 crimes that can trigger a lengthier sentence if they qualify as domestic terrorism. But one that isn’t on the list is the one example Cruz highlighted — attacking police officers:AdvertisementAssaulting a police officer with a dangerous weapon, a potential 20-year felony, isn’t on the list. Nor is obstruction of an official proceeding, another 20-year felony, or interfering with police during civil disorder, a five-year felony.Many of the actual, potentially provable Jan. 6 crimes that could involve the terrorism sentencing boost are smaller crimes, including destruction or “depredation” of federal property. That leaves prosecutors with a decision about whether to threaten someone with many years in prison for breaking a window, for example — something that has come up in the context of Jan. 6 — if their intent was to intimidate or coerce the government.Story continues below advertisementThus far, prosecutors seem more content to use a potential terrorism sentencing boost as a bargaining chip than something they’ll actually pursue, for a whole host of reasons including how harsh such sentences can be.And that’s relatively par for the course, including when it comes to those who engaged in violent actions and protests during racial justice demonstrations and other politically tinged matters that could seemingly qualify under the definitions at the top.AdvertisementIt’s certainly a grayer area than whether Jan. 6 qualified as an “insurrection” — especially if nobody is ultimately sentenced with a domestic terrorism enhancement, and given the connotations that come with the label “terrorist.” Even Attorney General Merrick Garland, in his speech Wednesday, notably avoided the word.But as Cruz’s commentary demonstrated — even in backing off his terrorism labeling — one needn’t cite a sentence invoking terrorism (or even one that could plausibly be criminally proved as such) to regard something broader as terrorism, morally speaking. Cruz knew that for 364 days and seems to still know that, but the politics of it demanded a different approach.",0,WashingtonPost
Could not be scraped,"When the dust settled on Jan. 6, 2021, even many prominent allies of President Donald Trump agreed that he was responsible — in some measure, and often in large measure — for the first major attack on the U.S. Capitol since the War of 1812:2021 Election: Complete coverage and analysisArrowRightThe No. 1 House Republican, Kevin McCarthy (Calif.), said Trump bore “responsibility,” while suggesting a historic censure of a sitting president.The No. 1 Senate Republican, Mitch McConnell (Ky.), said, “There’s no question, none, that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking” the attack.Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) said Trump’s rhetoric about a stolen election had been “irresponsible” and “reckless.” He added that Trump “went way too far over the line.”Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) called on Trump to “quit misleading the American people and repudiate mob violence” and said Jan. 6 was “in part a result of” such misleading claims.Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) said Trump’s call for protesters to march to the Capitol “was inciting.”Even Fox News host Tucker Carlson said on Jan. 7 that Trump had “recklessly encouraged” the events of the day.Exactly one year later, the Jan. 6 Capitol riot has basically served only to cement the very same former president’s hold on the same party. And that’s because of this: It was the most significant stress test on Trump’s hold on the party to date, and Trump’s hold bent but didn’t break.GOP leaders thought they might be able to break with Trump, only to be proved very wrong. The lesson for all of them was that there’s virtually nothing Trump could do to lose the base, and they should act accordingly.Story continues below advertisementToday, Republican leaders barely bother with discussing Trump’s culpability for what Cruz has repeatedly labeled (including this week) a “terrorist attack”; instead, they are drowned out by those in their midst downplaying the events of the day, likening those who were charged and jailed to political prisoners, and assuring that this is still Trump’s party and that it’s time to move on from the historic attack on U.S. government (often for transparently political reasons).AdvertisementThey also stand by silently as fellow Republicans who push the same “big lie” they blamed for fomenting the Jan. 6 attack run for high-profile offices — including those that control elections — with Trump’s backing.It is indeed still Trump’s party, and in rather remarkable measure.Story continues below advertisementThe Washington Post’s David Byler this week spotlighted a telling chart from FiveThirtyEight. Some Republicans have fallen out of favor in their party after Jan. 6; it just happens to be the Republicans who found themselves on other side of Trump on Jan. 6. The favorability ratings of McConnell and former vice president Mike Pence, who declined entreaties to help overturn the election on Jan. 6, dropped sharply almost immediately — and have stayed down.Trump’s consistent popularity with Republicans a year after his loss also is a departure from what usually happens to those who lose elections.AdvertisementSen. John McCain’s numbers among Republicans declined more than 20 points a year after his 2008 presidential loss and continued to decline over the following decade. Sen. Mitt Romney’s dropped by double digits a little more than a year after his 2012 presidential loss — and also continued to decline.Story continues below advertisementOn the Democratic side, it happened to a smaller degree with former secretary of state Hillary Clinton after her loss to Trump in 2016. Former vice president Al Gore was relatively popular during his 2000 campaign, but a New York Times/CBS News poll two years later found him disliked by twice as many Americans (43 percent) as viewed him positively (19 percent) — in large part because only one-third of Democrats had a favorable opinion.Trump is somewhat different in that he at least won a presidential election before losing one. (The last time we had a one-term president who lost reelection was after the 1992 election, when George H.W. Bush lost.) But Trump also has the distinction of having lost the House, the Senate and the presidency all in one term in office — the first time that’s happened since 1932.AdvertisementIf there were ever a moment to change course, out of sheer political calculation if nothing else, this would seem to have been it. Of course, Trump has convinced many that he actually won the 2020 election.Story continues below advertisementFor Republicans, though, the calculation is less about what’s ideal than what’s realistic and manageable. They — or at least their leaders — thought the play was to turn the page on the Trump era after the Capitol attack, whether out of principle or something else. They decided this was the moment to come at the party’s king, and they missed. They’ve since reversed course out of political ambition and self-preservation, effectively disowning or ignoring the supposedly principled stand they took earlier against a man they blamed for a historic attack.If past is predicate, the effect is that they probably won’t try again to criticize or break with him — or at least not try as hard. They’ll just hope against hope that they won’t be pushed into such a position again. But if they are, they’ll know that their momentary efforts to acknowledge reality and say what seems to be the right thing can be discarded just as quickly.They might not themselves fully embrace the guy who was responsible for the Jan. 6 attack, but they’ll continue to let their party do so without raising a fuss. Which is really the story of the past 365 days.Former president Donald Trump has remained the main driver of the Republican Party priorities, despite losing his reelection bid in 2020.

Could not be scraped,"About a month after the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection and with impeachment suddenly in the rearview, President Biden signaled he was “tired” of talking about Donald Trump. A month later, he responded to a question about the former president by sarcastically saying he missed “my predecessor.” Biden largely avoided mentioning Trump in the following months.2021 Election: Complete coverage and analysisArrowRightOn the anniversary of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot Thursday, though, Biden made a huge exception. He delivered a muscular speech aimed at repudiating the former president, whose hold on the Republican Party has proved as strong as ever, as well as the allies who fomented and excused the Capitol riot.Below are some takeaways from Biden’s speech.1. The Trump focusBiden’s intention to make his speech not just about the rioters but also about Trump was evident from the first minute of his brief speech and continued throughout. After praising those who withstood the attack and marking the somber occasion, Biden almost immediately linked the attack to Trump — and did so repeatedly, with a palpable anger in his voice.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“For the first time in our history, the president had not just lost an election; he tried to prevent the peaceful transfer of power as a violent mob breached the Capitol,” Biden said. “But they failed. They failed.”Biden added later: “He has done what no president in American history — the history of this country — has ever, ever done: He refused to accept the results of an election and the will of the American people.”Then Biden went after Trump’s delayed response.“What did we not see?” Biden said. “We didn’t see a former president who had just rallied the mob to attack, sitting in the private dining room off the Oval Office in the White House, watching it all on television and doing nothing for hours as police were assaulted, lives at risk, the nation’s capital under siege.”2. Not just targeting but goading TrumpMuch of Biden’s speech seemed aimed at not just criticizing but also goading Trump.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementHe referred to Trump’s “bruised ego” over losing the 2020 election.“He’s done so because he values power over principle, because he sees his own interest as more important than his country’s interest and America’s interest, and because his bruised ego matters more to him than our democracy or our Constitution,” Biden said.Biden also referenced the 81 million people who voted for him — a seeming reference to Trump and his allies’ regular invocations of the 74 million people who voted for Trump, and the idea that not further scrutinizing Trump’s baseless voter-fraud claims was tantamount to disregarding those voters.Biden also pointed to those who might otherwise be allies who clearly didn’t back up Trump’s claims.Story continues below advertisement“He can’t accept he lost, even though that’s what 93 United States senators, his own attorney general, his own vice president, governors and state officials in every battleground state — have all said he lost,” Biden said. “That’s what 81 million of you did, as you voted for a new way forward.”AdvertisementBiden punctuated it all toward the end of his speech by labeling Trump what Trump fears perhaps most of all: a loser.“He was just looking for an excuse, a pretext to cover for the truth: that he’s not just a former president; he’s a defeated former president,” Biden said, emphasizing “defeated” and then repeating it — “defeated by a margin of over 7 million of your votes in a full and free and fair election.”3. A recognition that being passive doesn’t workIt might have been a special occasion, but it also seemed to mark recognition that Trump is going nowhere, and one can’t pretend otherwise.Story continues below advertisementAt the same time, it echoed previous rebukes of Trump, in that Biden for some reason avoided saying his name. Former president George W. Bush did that in a late-2017 speech against Trump, and on Thursday there was a word curiously missing from Biden’s remarks: “Trump.”AdvertisementThroughout the speech, Biden merely cited the “former president” — at least 16 times in a little over 10 minutes — as if speaking his name was tantamount to legitimizing him, or that something would happen a la saying “Voldemort.”In Bush’s case and the cases of other Trump-critical Republicans over the past five years, it made some sense — politically, at least. Maybe people would think these were general points rather than targeted at one person, specifically? Maybe that would reduce the heat from one’s fellow partisans? Perhaps it would be understood as an appeal to better angels rather than a personal political attack?Story continues below advertisementBiden’s speech, though, was clearly targeted at one person in particular. And if you’re saying “all that I mean,” why not say all that you mean and make it even more explicit?4. The undersold rebukeToward the end, Biden referred to something that hasn’t gotten nearly enough attention: the implicit GOP idea that the presidential election was somehow stolen, but not other races.AdvertisementWe’ve also spotlighted this. A few days before Jan. 6, this comparison was pushed by none other than Republican Rep. Chip Roy (Tex.), who had been Sen. Ted Cruz’s (R-Tex.) former chief of staff. If the election results were suspect, Roy argued, why wouldn’t his fellow Republicans have objected to the seating of members who were elected on the same ballots? So Roy forced a vote, and all but two Republicans voted to seat the members.Story continues below advertisementHere’s Biden:Just think about this: The former president and his supporters have never been able to explain how they accept as accurate the other election results that took place on Nov. 3 — the elections for governor, United States Senate, House of Representatives — elections in which they closed the gap in the House. They challenged none of that. … Somehow those results were accurate on the same ballot, but the presidential race was flawed. On the same ballot, the same day, cast the same day by the same voters? The only difference: The former president didn’t lose those races; he just lost the one that was his own.Most of the down-ballot races in the states that Trump was challenging weren’t as close as the presidential race. But Trump was alleging voter fraud on a historic and massive scale. Given that, it’s an extremely valid proposition to ask why those results weren’t treated as suspect by those alleging that Trump might not have lost.Cruz’s former chief of staff laid the groundwork for making that point more than a year ago. And Biden rightfully raised it Thursday. It has certainly been a selective voter-fraud crusade.5. What happens nowThe question in the aftermath of Biden’s speech is what it means. Was this just about reminding people of an assault on democracy — one day only — or was it about spurring further action?AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementDemocrats have pushed for revamping the nation’s voting laws, citing Republican efforts to rewrite them in the states, but that doesn’t seem to be going anywhere. Democrats have also shunned GOP leaders’ suggestions that the two sides could meet in the middle, by reviewing the Electoral Count Act that Trump sought to exploit Jan. 6. Democrats have suggested this is a wholly insufficient step.An alternate political explanation is that Biden understands his agenda probably isn’t going anywhere. That argument suggests voters must be reminded of what happened in 2020 ahead of the 2022 election — when Democrats’ majorities are severely imperiled — and perhaps ahead of a potential 2024 rematch with Trump (or another Democrat running against Trump). When the calendar turns to an election year, after all, legislation tends to grind to a halt, and those concerns take precedence. Biden’s goading of Trump certainly doesn’t discount this theory.Either way, though, it’s a significant entry in the long-standing fight over democracy. And it was the most significant entry on that front from Biden to date.",0,WashingtonPost

She was 71.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightThe cause was complications from Alzheimer’s disease, her cousin, Sherrie Russell-Brown, said in an email.Ms. Guinier (pronounced gwuh-NEAR) spent much of her career at the elite levels of her profession as a graduate of one Ivy League law school and a professor at two others, as a Justice Department lawyer during the administration of President Jimmy Carter, and as a litigator for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund in the 1980s.Story continues below advertisementShe was a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania when she was nominated in 1993 to lead the Civil Rights Division. Some people said it was a job she had been training for all her life.AdvertisementSeeking to deal a blow to Clinton, conservative activists seized on Ms. Guinier’s articles in law journals to discredit her as a radical reformer who sought to overturn the country’s election system and remake society.In some of her writings, Ms. Guinier recommended changes in electoral procedures that would give Black citizens and other minorities a greater say in the outcome of legislation affecting their lives. Winner-take-all elections, Ms. Guinier argued, too often allow the majority to ignore the needs of everyone else. She called for proportional voting and other measures that would ensure increased representation of minorities and a more cooperative, nonpartisan approach to legislating.Story continues below advertisementIn a controversial article from 1991, she called for Black political candidates to be “not just physically black” but to demonstrate a “cultural and psychological view of group solidarity.” She advocated “anti-discrimination” policies under which “roughly equal outcomes, not merely an apparently fair process, are the goal.”AdvertisementMs. Guinier’s thinking has become more mainstream in recent years, as anti-racist practices and implicit bias training in the workplace have become more commonplace. In the early 1990s, however, these ideas proved to be incendiary. Conservative outlets launched an all-out assault on Ms. Guinier, led by the Wall Street Journal’s editorial page, which denounced her as a “quota queen.”Republicans were seeking political retribution after the bruising treatment of Supreme Court nominees Robert H. Bork and Clarence Thomas, which resulted in Bork’s rejection and Thomas’s narrow confirmation to the high court. (Thomas and Ms. Guinier were Yale Law School classmates.)Story continues below advertisementThe Clinton White House told Ms. Guinier not to give any interviews before her Senate confirmation hearings, which allowed political opponents to portray her in harsh, sometimes nastily personal ways. Senate Minority Leader Robert J.

He called her views “anti-democratic” and “very difficult to defend.”“I have always believed in democracy, and nothing I have ever written is inconsistent with that,” Ms. Guinier said in a news conference the next day. “I am a democratic idealist who believes that politics need not be forever seen as an `I win, you lose’ dynamic in which some people are permanent, monopoly winners and others are permanent, excluded losers.”Story continues below advertisementCivil rights leaders and advocates for women were outraged.

In her 1994 book “The Tyranny of the Majority,” she cited James Madison to warn that a narrow majority of voters could deny justice and a political voice to a substantial portion of the population.Story continues below advertisement“Where the majority is fixed and permanent, there are no checks on its ability to be overbearing,” Ms. Guinier wrote. “A majority that does not worry about defectors is a majority with total power. This is precisely the danger presented by racism.“My point is simple: 51 percent of the people should not always get 100 percent of the power; 51 percent of the people should certainly not get all the power if they use that power to exclude the 49 percent. In that case we do not have majority rule. We have majority tyranny.”Carol Lani Guinier was born April 19, 1950, in New York City and grew up in Queens.

Could not be scraped,"LAS VEGAS — President Biden and former president Barack Obama, speaking at former Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid’s memorial service Saturday, lavished praise on Reid’s pragmatic, dealmaking style, at times suggesting a pointed contrast with today’s all-or-nothing politics.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRight“At a time when so many Americans apply strict purity tests to politicians … Harry had a different view,” Obama said. “He didn’t believe in highfalutin’ theories or rigid ideologies.”He added that “in the battle between perfection and progress, Harry always chose progress,” and that Reid had “qualities that at this particular moment in our history seem especially relevant.”Story continues below advertisementBiden, who served with Reid for decades in the Senate, portrayed him as someone who worked out agreements and stuck to them. “If he gave you his word, he kept it. You could bank on it,” Biden said. “That’s how we got so much done.”AdvertisementBiden also noted: “None of it was easy. Not a lot of it was particularly popular when he was doing it.”In recent months, Biden and his White House have made it clear they have felt burned by lawmakers whose commitments they felt were less reliable, notably Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.).Harry Reid, pugnacious Senate leader, dies at 82Leading Democrats and hundreds of former staffers descended on this desert city to honor Reid, who died in December. Saturday’s service came with the Democratic Party at a crossroads, as the second half of Biden’s agenda is in jeopardy and many in the party expect significant losses in the midterm elections.Story continues below advertisementAgainst that backdrop, several of the leaders appeared to feel nostalgic for Reid’s hard-hitting but often effective tactics.The service, held in the Smith Center for the Performing Arts in downtown Las Vegas, was also attended by Vice President Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff, as well as the current Democratic leaders of the House and Senate.AdvertisementReid was first elected to Congress in 1982 but made his mark in the Senate, which he joined after winning a 1986 race and then rose to become Senate Minority leader in 2005. He went on to serve as Senate majority leader in 2007, after Democrats retook the majority through 2015, when they lost it again.Story continues below advertisementObama described his unlikely bond with Reid.“Given how different our backgrounds were, I did not know how well Harry and I would hit it off,” Obama said, recalling that an early sit-down in Reid’s office lasted a mere 10 minutes — which another senator reassured him was actually long for an audience with Reid.Obama noted that Reid encouraged him to run for president in 2008, at a time when few thought he could win and many other Democrats were coalescing around Hillary Clinton. He also credited Reid with helping to enact many of the biggest accomplishments of his presidency, including a $787 billion stimulus package.Advertisement“Few people have done more for this state and this country than this driven, brilliant, sometimes irascible, deeply good man from Searchlight, Nevada,” Obama said.Story continues below advertisementMost dramatically, Reid was able to wrangle the Senate’s 58 Democrats and two independents to approve the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which came to be known as Obamacare.Several speakers took note of Reid’s unlikely rise as a native of the tiny town of Searchlight who had to hitchhike to high school, had a stint as a boxer and lost several elections early in his career. “He never gave up,” Biden said.Once he became the Senate Democratic leader, “like every great leader, he led the Democratic caucus not just by speaking but by listening,” Biden said.The president also joked about the contrast between his own reputation for long-windedness and Reid’s laconic style. “Harry and I both liked to talk a lot,” Biden said, adding, “I’m just testing whether you’re asleep yet.”Biden, funerals and a bygone AmericaOn Capitol Hill, Reid had a reputation as a terse, sometimes pugnacious figure who was not afraid of political infighting.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementBut the speakers said that reflected a plain-spoken integrity rather than harshness. Obama spoke affectionately of Reid as “curmudgeonly” and noted that “Harry was not a schmoozer or a backslapper.”And he referred to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who had spoken before him and described Reid as reluctant to criticize other senators.“I heard Speaker Pelosi say she never heard him say anything bad about any of his colleagues,” Obama said, adding to laughter, “I don’t know about that, Nancy.”Various speakers also described Reid’s habit of abruptly hanging up the phone when he felt a conversation was over, often to the surprise of the person on the other end. “Every time I hear a dial tone, I think of Harry,” Biden said.Story continues below advertisementPelosi boasted jokingly that over the years, she had the honor of being hung up on by Reid more than anyone else. “Click,” Pelosi said, recounting the sound of a phone conversation with Reid ending.Advertisement“He was a man of few words — and he wanted everyone else to be a person of few words,” she added.Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) offered another picture of Reid, recounting a moment when he saw Reid engage in what he said was a passionate kiss with a woman other than his wife.It was election night 2006, when Democrat Claire McCaskill won her race in Missouri, a victory that gave control of the Senate to Democrats, and Reid rushed over and kissed McCaskill through the television screen.Story continues below advertisement“His lips remained attached to the TV screen for a full 10 seconds,” Schumer said. “I had to get up and wipe the copious spittle off the TV screen.”He also said that Reid was open to change, calling him a leader who knew “the Senate must adapt” — possibly a reference to an upcoming vote on changing the chamber’s rules to allow consideration of a voting rights measure.Advertisement“As we confront the challenges coming weeks and months ahead, I take comfort knowing that Harry is with us,” Schumer said.But much of the talk revolved around Reid’s no-nonsense style, including those telephone hang-ups.“One former colleague said, ‘To Harry, ‘Goodbye’ was an unnecessary word,’ ” Obama said. “It might not have been necessary for Harry, but it is for us.

Her remarks came during an exchange with Ben Flowers, Ohio’s solicitor general, as he referred to a brief filed by the American Commitment Foundation, which argued that the rise of the omicron variant had made the vaccine rules less relevant because vaccines do not appear especially effective against it.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement(We will not address remarks made by Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, which some readers also thought were wrong. The official court transcript suggested he had made an inflated statement about the annual flu: “Flu kills — I believe — hundreds of thousands of people every year.” The flu kills between 12,000 and 52,000 people in the United States a year, but the audio of the argument shows Gorsuch actually said that “flu kills, I believe, hundreds, thousands of people every year.” So the transcript is incorrect.)The FactsThe brief in question sought to update the court on latest scientific and technical information on the omicron variant, as that had emerged with force after the mandate was proposed. Epidemiologists Jay Bhattacharya of Stanford University and Andrew Bostom, who says he is affiliated with Brown University, helped advise on it.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementIts key argument, citing data from countries such as South Africa and Denmark, was that omicron cases were 80 percent less likely to get hospitalized (South Africa) and three times less likely to end up with hospital admissions than the delta variant (Denmark). Moreover, the brief argued, the case fatality rate in South Africa plunged dramatically when omicron became dominant.Flowers, who said he had been twice vaccinated and received a booster, participated remotely after testing positive for covid. His symptoms were said to be “exceptionally mild.”“My presence here as a triple vaccinated individual by phone” suggested “vaccines do not appear to be very effective in stopping the spread or transmission,” he said, though he added that vaccines are effective at preventing “severe consequences.” That’s when Sotomayor interrupted him to assert “those numbers show that omicron is as deadly and causes as much serious disease in the unvaccinated as delta did.” She argued that “saying it’s a different variant just underscores the fact” a workplace rule was needed.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementActually, as we have shown, that’s not what the brief said. In fact, it even argued that vaccinated individuals might be more likely to catch covid rather than unvaccinated individuals. (The brief refers mainly to people with two vaccine doses as “vaccinated,” not people who also received a booster.) The brief suggests “this may be because unvaccinated, covid-recovered patients have better protection versus omicron than vaccinated patients who never previously had covid.”Nevertheless, the spike in cases has led to increased hospitalizations, Sotomayor noted during the exchange. Almost 30 percent of intensive-care beds are filled with covid patients as of Jan. 8, according the Health and Human Services Department data.But then Sotomayor went off the rails: “We have over 100,000 children, which we’ve never had before, in serious condition and many on ventilators.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThat’s wildly incorrect, assuming she is referring to hospitalizations, given the reference to ventilators. According to HHS data, as of Jan. 8 there are about 5,000 children hospitalized in a pediatric bed, either with suspected covid or a confirmed laboratory test. This figure includes patients in observation beds. So Sotomayor’s number is at least 20 times higher than reality, even before you determine how many are in “serious condition.”Moreover, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there have been less than 100,000 — 82,843 to be exact — hospital admissions of children confirmed with covid since Aug. 1, 2020.Still, the current seven-day average (Dec. 30-Jan. 5) is 797, which is a sharp increase from the week before (441) and represents the peak seven-day average for children, the CDC said. So Sotomayor is not wrong to suggest the rate of pediatric admissions is cause for concern. On Monday, the American Academy of Pediatrics reported a sharp rise in pediatric cases, with many of the children unvaccinated. (Some children are hospitalized for other reasons and then test positive for covid through screenings at the hospital.)AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe Supreme Court media office did not respond to a request for comment.The Pinocchio TestIt’s important for Supreme Court justices to make rulings based on correct data.

John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota, announced Saturday that he will run for reelection in 2022, ending months of speculation about whether he would seek to remain in the Senate.Thune, 61, is the Senate minority whip, making him the No. 2 Republican in the chamber and a potential successor to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRight“South Dakota deserves a strong and effective senator who can deliver the results they expect,” he said in a statement. “I am uniquely positioned to get that job done, and I look forward to earning the support of South Dakotans in the 2022 election for U.S. Senate.”A former chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee and former chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, Thune first came to Capitol Hill in 1997 as the representative for South Dakota’s lone district, serving three terms before joining the Senate in 2004.How Republicans became the party of Trump’s election lie after Jan. 6Thune’s decision has been closely watched because he is considered a candidate for Republican leader whenever McConnell steps aside and because he has been on the receiving end of harsh criticism from former president Donald Trump, a situation that has caused other Republicans to leave Congress.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementIn December 2020, when Trump was still president, Thune drew his wrath when he criticized efforts by House Republicans to challenge the results of the election on Jan. 6, 2021, saying it would “go down like a shot dog.”Trump labeled him “Mitch’s boy” and a Republican in name only while urging Gov. Kristi L. Noem (R) to challenge Thune in a primary. Noem, who has been mentioned as a possible presidential candidate, indicated she had no interest in a Senate bid.Thune is widely favored to win another term. He hasn’t faced a serious challenge in South Dakota since his election. Democrats haven’t yet announced a candidate for the seat.Thune first won his Senate seat in 2004 after a competitive and expensive race against Democratic Sen. Tom Daschle, ending Daschle’s 18-year run in the chamber. Daschle was the Senate Democratic leader at the time of his defeat.After an often-tumultuous tenure, Daschle exits quietlyThune has, of late, pushed against the House investigation into the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, which was carried out by supporters of the former president. Thune has said investigating the attack could hurt Republican chances in the 2022 midterms.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“A lot of our members, and I think this is true of a lot of House Republicans, want to be moving forward and not looking backward,” Thune told CNN in May. “Anything that gets us rehashing the 2020 elections I think is a day lost on being able to draw a contrast between us and the Democrats’ very radical left-wing agenda.”Thune has also spent the last year pushing against President Biden’s agenda, calling parts of it a “$5 trillion down payment on socialism.”",0,WashingtonPost
Could not be scraped,"Bill Gardner is hardly a household name nationally, but when he announced this past week that he would be stepping down as New Hampshire secretary of state, the news drew stories in The Washington Post, the New York Times and on CNN.com. Such is the power, prominence and controversy surrounding New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation presidential primary.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightFor 45 years, Gardner has been the state’s leading protector of the Granite State’s prime status, clashing with political leaders from other states jealous of New Hampshire’s privileged position in the nominating calendar and sometimes putting himself at odds with other elected officials and party leaders in his own state.Though a Democrat, Gardner is fiercely independent and iconoclastic. He is an encyclopedia of knowledge of presidential primaries and in particular the evolution of New Hampshire’s place in that history. He knows what many in other states think about his state’s primary — that New Hampshire is unrepresentative of the nation as a whole and that its influence far exceeds its size and makeup — but he has a counterview.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“We are not representative, certainly, in some things,” he said during a telephone interview on Friday. “But there’s a lot of different factors that come into New Hampshire. What New Hampshire does have is a fair playing field. We don’t have one corporation that has a third of the workers, or one political figure who dominates how people will vote.”He declined to say which states might fit that description, but the gambling industry dominates Nevada, another early state in the calendar, and in 2020 at least, the endorsement from Rep. James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.) helped give Joe Biden a huge victory in that state’s presidential primary, another early contest, that quickly propelled Biden to the Democratic Party’s nomination.Gardner argues that, while it might not seem fair, New Hampshire has earned its position. “It’s a place where the little guy has a chance to come in and see a lot of people,” he said. “We saw that in 1968 and have seen it several times since. … It doesn’t happen every time, but it has happened. And it’s not the end of the [nominating] process, it’s the beginning of the process.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementHis 1968 reference was to then-Sen. Eugene McCarthy’s showing in the Democratic primary, when as an anti-Vietnam War candidate, the Minnesotan nearly got more votes than then-President Lyndon B. Johnson and claimed a moral victory. Within weeks, Johnson announced he would not seek reelection.In 1976, then-Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter, a dark horse Democratic candidate, made it to the White House with New Hampshire’s help. And there have been other cases that, while not leading to their party’s presidential nomination, changed the trajectory of the races those years. Those include upsets by Democratic Sen. Gary Hart (Colo.) in 1984, Republicans Pat Buchanan in 1996 and Sen. John McCain (Ariz.) in 2000, and independent Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) in 2016, who ran for the Democratic nomination.New Hampshire’s primary dates to 1916, a product of the progressive era, when many other states were experimenting with the idea of giving more power to individual voters rather than party leaders. Many states later gave them up, and by 1968, Gardner recalled, there were only about a dozen states with a presidential primary.“There’s a reason why it’s here,” he said of his state’s longevity in helping to pick presidents. “This wasn’t a sapling planted on the main street of a town. It happened here naturally and happened here without New Hampshire ever taking from anyone else. …  The people were willing to pay for it when it was not a national event.”Gardner has fended off efforts by other states to usurp New Hampshire’s pole position in the political calendar. Many years ago, he said, a young Democratic state legislator in Nevada named Harry Reid, who went on to become the U.S. Senate majority leader and who died last month, pushed legislation designed to challenge New Hampshire’s status. “I’ve got all the documents,” he said. “They were shipped to me.” Gardner said the bill was vetoed after a phone call from the then-New Hampshire governor to the then-Nevada governor.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementNevada isn’t the only state whose politicians have tried to dislodge New Hampshire. Politicians in Arizona and Delaware tried. For years, Carl Levin, the long-serving senator from Michigan who died in July, went after the Granite State, unsuccessfully. Gardner’s recollections of battles in 1996 and 2000 are as richly told — and detailed in their retelling — as if they had happened last year. He can still take a listener into the rooms where things happened, recounting from his point of view who said what to him and what he said in return.The New Hampshire secretary of state has the power to set the date of the presidential primary, and Gardner has adhered strictly to New Hampshire’s law, which says no other similar contest can be held earlier. Iowa, which stages the first contest every four years, gets a carve-out because it has party caucuses, rather than a primary. Those caucuses are under even more challenge today after the botched counting in 2020 and concerns that caucuses disenfranchise some voters.New Hampshire long was a proving ground that counted, with no one in the modern era who finished below second place going on to win the presidency that year. Biden broke that tradition in 2020 when he finished a weak fifth but nonetheless emerged as the Democratic nominee.Gardner not only has dealt with efforts to dislodge New Hampshire’s place in the calendar, he also had to fight off a challenge to his position from within his own party.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe secretary of state is elected by the state legislature, and for many years, Gardner enjoyed bipartisan support and faced no opposition. In 2018, however, he drew a Democratic opponent, who criticized him for his participation in the election integrity commission assembled by President Donald Trump.Trump falsely claimed that millions of undocumented immigrants had voted in 2016. Gardner’s challenger, Colin Van Ostern, said Gardner had helped provide legitimacy to what Trump had claimed by serving on the committee. Gardner prevailed by four votes on a second ballot.Trump’s commission dissolved in controversy, but not before Gardner confronted its chairman, Kris Kobach, about allegations of problems in New Hampshire. Before its demise, New Hampshire Democratic elected officials called on Gardner to step down, but he refused with a blast back at those politicians. Gardner then and now defended his decision to be a member. “It’s better to be at the table than on the menu,” he said at the time.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementHe’s gone against Democrats in other ways. Recently, he testified against the For the People Act, the Democratic-sponsored voting bill, and disapproves of a second version that is stalled in the Senate. He said the legislation amounts to a federal intrusion into state responsibility. New Hampshire’s Democratic senators and representatives have taken issue with him publicly.Gardner said he dislikes how Trump has behaved since losing the 2020 election. But he believes there are widespread concerns about the integrity of elections that go across party lines and that predate Trump’s election. “We have to have not only fair, free and equal elections,” he said. “We have to have people believing there should be fair, free and equal elections. That is fundamental. And if one side doesn’t believe it, that is a problem. And we can’t just say they’re terrible people. We’re not going to get there [that way].”“Why are we the longest surviving free democratic society?” he asked. “Because we’ve had stability. We’ve had people coming in and being part of the country. …  We’re one country. We’re diverse, yes, but diversity has been our strength.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementGardner believes dialogue across political lines is essential, but many argue that, given what Trump has done and the willingness of most in his party to embrace those falsehoods, that isn’t possible until Trump’s influence has been dislodged.Gardner has been a fixture in New Hampshire for nearly half a century. He leaves office at a moment of political crisis and distrust. After he departs, his state’s presidential primary likely will face future challenges, but it is the larger question about the future of democracy that poses the bigger issue. Out of office, Gardner said, he plans to be part of that debate.",0,WashingtonPost

She worked in the Longworth House Office Building.More than a year later, Bertha Alisia Guerrero’s psychological pain remains raw.When the Capitol Hill staffer recalls the Jan. 6 insurrection, the distress in her voice and the tears in her eyes expose a deep emotional injury that hasn’t healed.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRight“Part of me feels wounded. I’m sad,” she said Thursday, her voice breaking, on the first anniversary of the U.S. Capitol attack by rioters who refused to accept that Donald Trump is a loser.But while they did not stop congressional certification of the former president’s election defeat, their attack on democracy eroded a sense of safety and security on the Hill, especially among Black employees. A number of staffers have resigned because of insurrection-related stress.Capitol workers quit jobs that once made them proud after attackTo support workers on the Hill, two dozen civic organizations formed Capitol Strong, a coalition designed to support Congress and its people, the week after the riot. “We understand that for many the attack felt deeply personal, particularly for staffers of color,” says a coalition statement. The coalition includes the U.S. Capitol Historical Society, which is conducting an oral history project about Jan. 6 with Hill employees so their stories will not be lost.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“I know for me and for many of my colleagues, the trauma of that day still lingers,” said Guerrero, chief of staff to Rep. Jimmy Gomez (D-Calif.). “The trauma comes at you like waves. It’s not always present. But I’ve seen little things just kind of trigger strong feelings and emotions.”With the rest of the staff teleworking because of the coronavirus pandemic, Guerrero was the only one in Gomez’s Longworth House Office Building suite, just across the street from the Capitol, during the attack. She locked the doors and turned off the lights to make it appear that the office was empty. Then she got a pair of scissors in case she needed to fight for her life.“I felt very alone and very scared,” she said.Story continues below advertisementShe is not alone in suffering from chronic trauma. It’s a trauma that a clinical psychologist, who also is a former member of Congress, said is “far worse” than the lingering emotions generated by the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.AdvertisementBrian Baird, a Washington state Democrat who served in the House from 1999 to 2011, said he could see the Pentagon explode that day from his congressional office. He held workshops for staffers after the terrorist attacks and following the insurrection.After 9/11, “everybody pulled together. The threat was external. The response was unity,” he said. “All of that flipped on Jan. 6.”Jan. 6 certainly was not worse than 9/11 in terms of lives and property lost, but it was more difficult emotionally, according to Baird: “The threat was internal … you were being attacked by your fellow Americans. And the leaders of the threat were the president of the United States of America and members of the United States Congress … the terrorists and … their leadership were domestic.”Story continues below advertisementThen, adding to the psychological distress, congressional staffers continue to work with and be respectful to Republican lawmakers who, Baird said, “may have egged on people who threatened your life or that of your peers.”AdvertisementTrumpism and Jan. 6 apologists remain strong. For Hill staffers and other feds, the feeling of being under attack began under Trump well before Jan. 6, and continues.“The threats against Congress have grown exponentially over the last five years,” U.S. Capitol Police Chief Thomas Manger told my Washington Post colleague Tom Jackman this month.All this has eroded the sense of security on the generally well-protected Hill.The domestic attackers also fed on racism, as demonstrated by the Confederate flags carried and the n-word slung at an African American police officer as the mob overran the Capitol.“As a Black woman who survived the insurrection, I feel an even heavier burden in the healing process because of the racial undertones that exacerbated the traumas of that day,” Kwentoria Williams, who formerly worked in the Rayburn House Office Building, said in an email. “Things I once ignored and wrote off as ignorance now trigger me. Rebel flags, swastikas, MAGA paraphernalia.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementA few weeks after the attack on the Capitol, “I had a meltdown at a clothing store because there was a power outage and I felt trapped,” recalled Williams. “Palms sweaty and tears starting to well in my eyes, I started to hyperventilate. The fear that any unexpected change in my environment is a sign of imminent danger started on the 6th. I underestimated how bad that day would be. I couldn’t make that mistake again.”She explained her decision to resign her congressional gig in a September blog post: “I just couldn’t shake the trauma of January 6th, and I needed … an environment that wasn’t a constant reminder of that day.”More than 100 Capitol Police officers also are among the Hill workers who have left their jobs since the insurrection, The Post reported this month.Story continues below advertisementUnlike elected lawmakers or even the Capitol Police, most Hill staffers “don’t get much attention or support,” said Max Stier, president and chief executive of the Partnership for Public Service, one of the organizations in the Capitol Strong coalition. “And I don’t think we’ve adequately recognized the harm that was done to them, that their very core notions of safety, both physical and psychological, were upended.”AdvertisementIt’s not just Hill employees like Guerrero and Williams who are dealing with lingering trauma. Federal agency employees took Trump’s 2016 campaign pledge to “drain the swamp” personally, and that feeds their apprehension about what his followers could still do.Marlo Bryant-Cunningham, president of the American Federation of Government Employees unit at the Office of Personnel Management, said most of her members “are people of color, and they are very afraid” that an attack could happen again. “We basically feel like we have a target on our back.”Story continues below advertisementSince the attack on the Capitol last year, she has received a record number of requests for counseling through the Employee Assistance Program, she said, “specifically because of the insurrection.”And it is not just federal employees who feel under siege. Local public health officials have been run out of office over pandemic restrictions. School board members have been threatened over nonexistent critical race theory curriculums.“This is about collective paranoid madness,” Baird said. “And it is dangerous, profoundly dangerous.”",0,WashingtonPost

Could not be scraped,"The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention took a calculated gamble Friday as she sought to assume greater control over confused public health messaging about the coronavirus as the pandemic enters its third year.FAQ: What to know about the omicron variant of the coronavirusArrowRightRochelle Walensky held her first solo covid-19 news conference since becoming the chief of the public health agency nearly a year ago, vowing that it would be “the first of many.”The briefing comes at a precarious moment for Walensky, a highly regarded infectious-diseases physician who has come under intense criticism for failing to communicate CDC’s often-changing guidance clearly. With coronavirus cases surging to record levels in the United States and around the world, that criticism has been particularly stinging of late, with an uncharacteristically sharp critique this week from the American Medical Association over the agency’s failure to require a negative coronavirus test result before people exit shortened isolation.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“Potentially hundreds of thousands of people could return to work and school infectious if they follow the CDC’s new guidance on ending isolation after five days without a negative test,” the group said.What the CDC’s latest guidance says about how long you need to isolate or quarantineOver the past two months, the Biden administration has urged Americans to get coronavirus vaccine boosters without changing its “fully vaccinated"" definition. (JM Rieger/The Washington Post)Inside the administration, frustration has also been mounting. Officials acknowledge the rapidly changing virus complicates the pandemic response, but some worry Walensky’s public statements have only added to many Americans’ confusion. At times, her guidance has also been at odds with that of other senior administration officials, most notably, that of Anthony S. Fauci, President Biden’s chief medical adviser.Though some outside experts have called on Biden to change the agency’s leadership, administration officials say the president has no such plans. They say ousting the director amid a new wave of cases would be ill-advised.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementFor months, at the suggestion of the White House, Walensky has been receiving media coaching from Democratic media consultant Mandy Grunwald, according to an administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Grunwald did not respond to messages for comment. Grunwald’s role was first reported by CNN.CDC spokesman Jason McDonald said in a statement that directors “have historically consulted coaches and other outside advisers to improve communications and media interview skills. This is not out of the ordinary.”Walensky offered no apologies on Friday. But she did acknowledge the challenges of staying on top of a fast-evolving virus, saying the CDC is “working really hard to get information to the American public. This is hard, and I am committed to continue to improve as we learn more about the science and to communicate that with all of you.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAnd although she did not back off any of the agency’s more controversial recommendations, she took questions on an array of issues, including the record rise in pediatric hospitalizations, why she had not recommended people get tested before leaving isolation and what people should do to return safely to school and work.Experts say Walensky has nothing to lose by “putting herself out there” to improve her relationship with the public, said Jody Lanard, a physician who worked for nearly two decades as a pandemic communications adviser consulting with the World Health Organization.“I’m not worried about the White House throwing the CDC under the bus, because the CDC is already under the bus,” Lanard said.Story continues below advertisementLanard said the single most important messaging task for Walensky is to acknowledge, “in a confident tone, with no self-flagellation, that many people have told her that her communications have been confusing and unclear.”AdvertisementWalensky did not do that directly in her briefing, but a federal health official said she understands that people are confused and have questions, and that’s why she put herself in front of a group of reporters.Although Walensky has participated in dozens of regular briefings as part of the White House covid-19 response team, those sessions include multiple officials and limited time for follow-up questions, and Walensky seldom strays from talking points. When she has — most notably in February when she said teachers did not need to be vaccinated to reopen schools — the White House said she was “speaking in her personal capacity.”Story continues below advertisementOne agency scientist who listened to Friday’s call and who interacts with Walensky regularly said he was disappointed that she did not directly acknowledge the confusion generated by the isolation and testing guidance.Advertisement“The lack of recognition that there is a problem — that’s a problem,” the scientist said, noting they had had to spend time explaining it to family members. “You kind of have to be a PhD or an MPH [master of public health],” the scientist said.The scientist also said some CDC officials involved in the coronavirus response had raised questions about the decisions to shorten isolation time and to omit a requirement for a test.Experts inside and outside the agency say Walensky is articulate and smart and comes across more effectively when talking to other scientists and public health officials than during White House briefings or media appearances. They hope she can communicate that to the broader public by doing more regular solo sessions. “She’s amazingly bright and I’ve been in conversations with her where she’s processing information and asking questions on the fly, and she is nothing but impressive,” the scientist said.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementFormer CDC Director Tom Frieden welcomed the news the agency was holding its own briefings with subject-matter experts. “These briefings are helpful in sharing what we are learning when we are learning it, explaining and providing the basis of recommendations, and answering important questions from journalists,” he said in a statement. “I hope this will be an inflection point in rebuilding confidence in CDC.”But other experts say it’s time to make bigger changes about who the administration puts out front. “Brilliant clinicians, brilliant researchers are not necessarily brilliant communicators,” said Jay A. Winsten, director of strategic media initiatives at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who described the communications situation as at a “tipping point.”Even on a late-night talk show, he said that Walensky laid out the agency’s recommendations almost in terms of a physician’s decision tree — “If ‘a,’ then 'b'; if ‘b,’ then ‘c,’” — leading the host, Stephen Colbert, to remark on how convoluted the message seemed.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“It’s the way a physician thinks. That’s how they make diagnoses,” Winsten said.CDC scientists and experts say the agency is trying to move more quickly to respond to constantly changing science about the virus. Matthew Seeger has researched crisis communication for the past 35 years at Wayne State University and helped the CDC develop a manual outlining how U.S. leaders should talk to the public after the 2001 anthrax attacks.“But we really can’t deploy the science without effective communication, and this is the place we have really fallen down,” Seeger said.What’s more, he said, public health officials never expected such politicization of public health messages where individuals and organizations are intentionally distorting information. “The public has a different set of expectations for the CDC, and I’m not sure the CDC has really come to grips with that,” he said.Frances Stead Sellers contributed to this report.",0,WashingtonPost
Could not be scraped,"Conservative Supreme Court justices on Friday appeared skeptical that the Biden administration has legal authority to impose a broad coronavirus vaccination-or-testing requirement on large employers, casting doubt on President Biden’s most ambitious plan to fight the pandemic.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightBut there was a different reaction to the administration’s vaccine mandate for health-care personnel at facilities that receive federal Medicaid and Medicare funds. Some of the justices who expressed doubt about the general workplace requirements seemed more open to the idea that federal officials could require those workers to get vaccinated for the coronavirus.The answer to both could come quickly — the court is considering emergency petitions either to allow the regulations to go into effect or to stop them, and both sides asked the court to act soon.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementIt is highly unusual for the justices to hold oral arguments on emergency requests, but Friday’s session went more than three and a half hours. It underscored the national debate over the threat of the coronavirus and the political division over how large a role government can play in requiring its citizens to be vaccinated.There was a real-time dynamic as well. Besides the impending deadlines, some justices came armed with the latest numbers on the surging omicron variant, and their very actions displayed their concern.All of the justices have been vaccinated and received boosters, but for the first time since they resumed in-person arguments, all began Friday’s session masked, with the exception of Justice Neil M. Gorsuch. His seatmate, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, 67 and diagnosed with diabetes as a child, participated remotely from her chambers.On. Jan 7, the Supreme Court will hear challenges to the Biden administration’s vaccine policies affecting nearly 100 million workers. Here’s what to know. (Julie Yoon/The Washington Post)What’s at stake with the Biden vaccine requirement policiesIn weighing previous challenges to coronavirus restrictions and requirements, the court has been largely deferential to states — but skeptical of the powers of federal agencies. That seemed to be the case when the court considered the rule proposed by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), which would cover about 80 million workers.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementA majority of justices seemed inclined to agree with private businesses and 27 Republican-led states challenging the order that OSHA’s proposed action was beyond a federal agency’s powers.Such a workplace requirement “sounds like the sort of thing that states will be responding to or should be, and that Congress should be responding to … rather than agency by agency, the federal government, the executive branch acting alone,” said Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.Washington lawyer Scott A. Keller, representing the National Federation of Independent Business, said it was an unprecedented imposition by the federal government on private workplaces.“Our nation’s businesses have distributed and administered hundreds of millions of covid vaccines to Americans. Businesses have encouraged and incentivized their employees to get vaccines,” Keller told the court. “But a single federal agency tasked with occupational standards cannot commandeer businesses economywide into becoming de facto public health agencies.”Gorsuch seemed to agree with Roberts. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. asked questions even more skeptical. Justice Amy Coney Barrett wondered if the regulation was drawn too broadly or should be more targeted at specific industries and workplaces, rather than imposed on all businesses with 100 or more employees.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe court’s three liberal justices seemed confident the federal agencies had proper authority in both cases and exasperated by the questioning.Several times, Justice Stephen G. Breyer mentioned that there were “nearly three-quarters of a million people, new cases” every day.“I would find it, you know, unbelievable that it could be in the public interest to suddenly stop these vaccinations,” Breyer said.“More and more people are dying every day. More and more people are getting sick every day,” said Justice Elena Kagan. “This is the policy that is most geared to stopping all this.”Keller said state officials and private businesses can and have acted to protect workers, but that the federal government’s policy would impose new costs and cause a “massive economic shift” by leading employees to quit.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementSotomayor pointed out that “catching covid keeps people out of the workplace for extraordinary periods of time.”Ohio Solicitor General Benjamin M. Flowers, who made his argument by phone because he tested positive for coronavirus in advance of the hearing, said the Biden administration’s policy was too sweeping in scope and “not truly intended to regulate a workplace danger. It’s a danger that we all face simply as a matter of waking up in the morning.” He noted that vaccinations cannot be undone.FAQ: What to know about the omicron variant of the coronavirusBut Solicitor General Elizabeth B. Prelogar, representing the Biden administration, said the policy is at the heart of the federal government’s responsibility.Story continues below advertisement“Exposure to covid-19 on the job is the biggest threat to workers in OSHA’s history,” Prelogar said. “The court should reject the argument that the agency is powerless to address that grave danger.”AdvertisementThe hearing took place in a building that has been closed to the public for nearly two years because of the pandemic. Only court staff, lawyers in the cases, credentialed reporters and the justices’ law clerks are allowed to attend oral arguments, and all must be masked and possess negative coronavirus test results.Technically, the court is not deciding the legality of the administration’s initiatives, only whether they may be implemented while lawsuits challenging them continue.Story continues below advertisementBut the questioning focused on the merits of the cases and whether federal agencies have proper authority to impose rules that could boost the nation’s vaccination rate, which is almost 65 percent.Supreme Court sets special hearing on Biden vaccine policiesThe other challenged policy is a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services vaccination requirement for what the White House says is more than 17 million health-care workers at 76,000 facilities that receive federal money tied to those programs.AdvertisementThe administration points to federal law that gives the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services the ability to impose requirements necessary for the “health and safety” of patients.For decades, it says, the secretary has had authority to require participating health-care providers to establish programs for the prevention and control of infectious diseases within the facilities.Story continues below advertisementIn court Friday, Brian H. Fletcher, the administration’s principal deputy solicitor general, said many health-care workers already are required to be vaccinated against hepatitis, measles and the flu and that the medical community overwhelmingly supports the policy.“I think it would be bizarre to say that the secretary’s authority to protect the health and safety of Medicare and Medicaid patients does not include the authority to adopt a measure that you see other regulators adopting, the medical community urging and other providers adopting voluntarily,” Fletcher said.AdvertisementRoberts and Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh seemed more receptive to the argument that the administration has sway over those workers and facilities.Story continues below advertisementRoberts noted the close connection between coronavirus and the risk to elderly and low-income patients treated at facilities that receive federal funds.“People already get sick when they go to the hospital, but if they go and face covid-19 concerns, well, that’s much worse,” Roberts said.Kavanaugh wondered why the states were bringing the challenge if the rule would be such an imposition on facilities and their workers.“Where are the regulated parties complaining about the regulation?” he asked.Missouri Deputy Attorney General Jesus A. Osete said the regulations would make dedicated health-care workers “choose between losing their jobs and complying with the government’s vaccine mandate.”AdvertisementHe said it would create an “imminent crisis” in rural areas where objecting workers cannot be easily replaced.Louisiana solicitor general Elizabeth Murrill, also forced to make her arguments remotely because of the court’s testing requirement, said the rules would “force millions of people working for or with a Medicare or Medicaid provider to undergo invasive, irrevocable, forced medical treatment.”Kagan was unmoved. All the government is saying with the vaccination requirement, she said, is “the one thing you can’t do is to kill your patients. So you have to get vaccinated so that you’re not transmitting the disease that can kill elderly Medicare patients, that can kill sick Medicaid patients.”But Gorsuch was wary of the government conditioning funds on the vaccine requirement. “Could it mean, should it mean, have we in other cases interpreted similar language to mean, you can’t use money in a way that commandeers a state or private entity?” he asked.A panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit dismissed a request from Florida to stop the requirement. But a district judge in Missouri stopped the rules, and the 5th Circuit agreed with a challenge from Louisiana.In the workplace regulation, federal law grants OSHA authority to issue emergency rules for up to six months to protect employees “exposed to grave danger” from “substances or agents determined to be toxic or physically harmful or from new hazards.” The administration contends that gives OSHA not only the authority but also the responsibility to act.The temporary rule would give companies with 100 or more workers a choice: mandate all employees be vaccinated or require unvaccinated employees to provide weekly negative coronavirus test results and wear face coverings to work on-site.The rules were set to take effect Jan. 4, but OSHA pushed back the date in response to the litigation and said it would not immediately issue citations for those not in compliance.Soon after the administration announced the rules for private companies in November, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit blocked enforcement of the policy.But lawsuits emerged around the nation and were consolidated for review by a different court. A panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit dissolved the 5th Circuit’s stay, saying the rules could go into effect.Because of the uncertainty surrounding the litigation, OSHA announced that it would not penalize companies for not complying with employee testing requirements before Feb. 9, as long as employers show “reasonable, good faith efforts” to meet the standards.In response to concerns about a shortage of health-care workers, Fletcher told the court that the HHS secretary has given facilities some flexibility to meet the new requirements, including an additional 60 days to get employees fully vaccinated. The agency also will hold off on any enforcement action, Fletcher said, as long as 90 percent of the workforce is vaccinated and the facility has a plan to immunize its remaining workers.The OSHA cases are National Federation of Independent Business v. Department of Labor and Ohio v. Department of Labor. The health-care worker cases are Biden v. Missouri and Becerra v. Louisiana.",0,WashingtonPost

And he made a four-hour round trip to Wilmington on a Wednesday night in May to drop in at the viewing of a longtime former Senate aide.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightAll while running the country.On Saturday, President Biden will attend what is at least his seventh event as president to commemorate the death of a friend or former colleague when he speaks at a memorial service for Harry M. Reid, the former Senate majority leader who served with Biden for years.Story continues below advertisementIf a president’s most valuable resource is his time, this one has made a particular point of setting aside hours to grieve, console and mark the friendships he’s built over his roughly half-century in public office. It’s an under-the-radar but particularly Bidenesque ritual, say longtime aides and friends, who explain his desire to make room for funerals and eulogies as a consequence of his relationship-driven approach.AdvertisementThough attending funerals is frequently caricatured as the purview of vice presidents, in this administration Biden has made sure to go himself, and may have attended even more if not for the coronavirus pandemic.The tendency to show up for those in mourning is a pattern of his years in public office.Story continues below advertisementTed Kaufman, a former Delaware senator and longtime aide to Biden, said that staffers throughout his career have figured out quickly not to fight him too hard on attending these events.“When you’re a staff person for anyone, there are certain things they do that you don’t agree with,” Kaufman said. “But if you’re smart, and you’re staff, and you do it for a while, you figure out, ‘That’s who they are.’ ”For Biden, eulogizing colleagues, especially Republicans, is also a resonant way to reiterate his core message that the country must return to a less-polarized time when political adversaries did not have to be personal enemies.AdvertisementNot everyone believes that era can be revived, however. And in a sense, Biden’s attendance at these events highlights the extent to which practitioners of that kind of politics are increasingly passing from the scene.Story continues below advertisementAnd as the oldest president, at 79, Biden may simply be experiencing more of his peers passing away than his predecessors did. Reid’s memorial service Saturday is expected to feature remarks not only from Biden but also from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and former president Barack Obama.Reid’s body will lie in state in Washington next week, which would have been a more convenient time for Biden to pay respects had he chosen to do so.Liberals pay tribute to ReidBiden’s ability to stretch his schedule to accommodate the events at times surpasses his wife’s. The president, speaking in November at a Milford, Del., funeral for former Delaware governor Ruth Ann Minner explained in his address why he was there solo, saying, “The reason Jill is not with me today is she’s teaching today, full time as a professor at Northern Virginia Community College.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAllies argue that Biden’s focus on grief and empathy is particularly important for the country at a moment where more than 800,000 lives have been lost to the pandemic. But his tendency to go to funerals and give eulogies has been long a part of his political brand, the way other politicians call supporters on their birthdays.Joe Biden and the politics of griefIt’s a stark contrast particularly with former president Donald Trump, who has famously skipped significant commemoration services. Trump did not attend the service for John McCain, with whom he often tangled, at the insistence of the late senator’s family. Biden, then out of office, went to Arizona to speak at it.Biden’s attempts to connect with grieving families don’t always hit the mark. In August, when the president greeted family members of U.S. soldiers who had died during the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, several family members said they felt that Biden dwelled on his own tragic past and that his remarks seemed scripted and shallow.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThose close to Biden note the tragedy he’s experienced in his own life. He lost his wife and daughter in a 1972 car accident just before Christmas. In May 2015, he lost another son to brain cancer.“Joe Biden has a deep spirituality that has been shaped by living through grief, by the experience of getting up and living again after having been knocked down so hard that it would take your breath away,” said Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.), a longtime friend.Coons said Biden has always been known in their shared small state as a person who would come to funerals and memorial services. He recalled attending a service for a Delaware bar owner who helped launch his career when a motorcade pulled up and in came Biden, who was then serving as vice president. Biden then waited in a long line to comfort the family.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“Only when I became a senator did I realize he doesn’t just do that in Delaware,” Coons said.Biden’s role does not stop after a funeral is over, according to aides and friends. He regularly checks in with people who have lost loved ones on key dates, including the birthday of the deceased and the first holiday after the death. Sometimes the calls come on multiple milestones — the first month after the loss, the first six months, the first year.To manage the process Biden’s staff has kept a list of people Biden has promised to stay in touch with along with key dates, according to a person familiar with Biden’s operation who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share Biden’s private process. A White House spokesman said that as president, Biden has detailed notes to help him keep his word.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementWhen Biden delivers eulogies, he spends hours poring over the text, according to former staff members. His speechwriters, who are trained at crafting sweeping policy addresses, are at times flummoxed because they do not always know the intricacies of the relationship that Biden had with the deceased. Former aides and Jill Biden may contribute material, but ultimately Biden rewrites the final product himself.“He pours himself into preparation for these things,” Kaufman said. “He’s got really good speechwriters and really good people helping him. But when he does a eulogy, it’s handmade. He just really labors over it.”The services, and his desire to participate in them, represent the era when Biden came of age as a politician: A time when lawmakers had a certain collegiality even if they disagreed bitterly on policy. Biden as president has so attended an equal number of events honoring Democrats and Republicans (though the Reid event will tip the balance to the Democratic side).AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe Republicans include Colin Powell, who in addition to being secretary of state was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and former Sens. Bob Dole and John Warner.Some say that will not happen in years to come.“Can you imagine some Democratic senator wanting to go to Josh Hawley’s funeral or Ted Cruz’s?” said Bill Kristol, who was former vice president Dan Quayle’s chief of staff, referring to the combative senators from Missouri and Texas. “Not to be macabre about it, but in 20 years that would be the equivalent.”Powell praised by politicians of both partiesSpeaking at Warner’s funeral in June of last year at Washington National Cathedral, Biden praised the former senator’s dedication to American democracy, making an implicit contrast with Trump and his followers.“He understood that democracy is more than a form of government — democracy is a way of being,” Biden said of Warner. “He understood it begins and grows in an open heart, and with the willingness to work across the aisle and come together in common cause.”AdvertisementHe made a similar point at Dole’s memorial.“In his final days, Bob made it clear that he was deeply concerned about the threat to American democracy, not from foreign nations but from the divisions tearing us apart from within,” Biden said.But that eulogy was also laced with anecdotes only he could know, such as Biden’s recollection of a Senate vote to defund Amtrak.Dole, he recalled, voted against his own Republican Party to keep funds flowing to the train service, which Biden was known to use frequently to commute home to Delaware. When asked why, Biden recalled that Dole quipped, “It’s the best way to get Joe Biden the hell out of here at night so he’s not here in the morning.”Biden-Dole bond speaks to a bygone WashingtonNot all of Biden’s presidential eulogies have been in public.The presidential motorcade pulled up to Washington National Cathedral just before noon on a late September 2021 day for a memorial service for Susan Bayh, the former first lady of Indiana, who died in February of brain cancer, just like Biden’s son Beau.Her husband, former governor and senator Evan Bayh, said in an interview that he had not been sure Biden would make the event until the day before. “I mean, who knows what’s going to happen on the president’s calendar?” Bayh said.Biden walked into the cathedral and spent about ten minutes privately consoling his former Senate colleague and his sons. “That was extraordinarily meaningful for them,” Bayh said. “And they’ll remember it the rest of their lives.”Biden spoke at the beginning of the service, Bayh said. Then took his seat and stayed for the full two hours. Afterward, he made a beeline for Susan Bayh’s sister to privately console her.“He is the busiest man in the world,” Bayh said. “But he’s not forgotten what it’s like to be an ordinary person, and in particular, what it’s like to experience loss and grief.”",0,WashingtonPost
Could not be scraped,"The good news from the jobs report released on Friday morning was that the unemployment rate dropped to 3.9 percent. As you may know, this is measured with a different survey than the one that tallies how many workers are employed, meaning that, at times, there can be a disconnection between the two figures. That was the case on Friday: Economists predicted that more jobs would be added, meaning that the numbers were lower than expected, but the decline in the unemployment rate was good news.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightBut there’s an important caveat to that unemployment rate number. It is calculated by figuring out how many of those who are working or looking for work don’t have jobs. But that means that if more people simply drop out of the labor force — that is, they aren’t looking for work — the unemployment rate can go down even without more people getting jobs.Sign up for How To Read This Chart, a weekly data newsletter from Philip BumpA simple example is useful. Imagine 100 people, 80 of whom are working and 10 of whom are looking for work. The other 10 aren’t in the labor force. For this group, the unemployment rate is 11.1 percent — 10 out of the 90 people in the labor force aren’t working. Now imagine that five of those who are working and five of those who were looking drop out of the labor force, say, through retirement. Now there are five people unemployed out of 80 people in the labor force, so the unemployment rate drops to 6.3 percent, even though the number of people working has gone down from 90 to 85 of 100.That’s not exactly what’s happening here. The labor force participation rate (the percentage of a population that’s working or looking for work) remained the same from November to December. But the participation rate in December was 1.5 percentage points lower than February 2020, meaning that there are fewer people in the labor pool and, therefore, meaning that the same number of unemployed people would lead to a lower unemployment rate.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAs you might expect, participation rates vary depending on age. Older Americans are more likely to have retired, so a lower percentage of that group is in the labor force at any given time. In recent years, the participation rate among those 55 and over has been fairly flat as the rate among those aged 25 to 54 has increased. (The graph below uses figures for January of each year, meaning that the value for 2020 excludes the effects of the pandemic.)But that overlaps with another trend: America is getting older. That sounds like a necessarily true statement, but, in the past, there have been times at which more young people have been born, driving down the country’s median age. The baby boom, for example, which began in 1946 and ended in 1964, led to the United States becoming consistently younger even as Americans themselves aged.The baby boom started 75 years ago. Since the baby boom was so big, that means that the generation that once pushed America’s median age down is now quickly pushing it up.Consider what this means in terms of labor-force participation. Lots of people moved from the high-participation 25 to 54 age group into the lower-participation 55 and up age group over the past decade as boomers aged. In 2011, boomers started hitting retirement age, leading to their exiting the labor force entirely.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe Bureau of Labor Statistics tallies data on employment status in five-year increments, so we can’t divide out the baby boom explicitly when considering how much of the adult population is or isn’t working or seeking work. But we can create categories: age groups younger or older than the boom, baby boomers, and age groups that, in a given year, contain both boomers and Americans older or younger than the boom.Let’s look at employment in three months: December 2011 (right as boomers began retiring), December 2016 and December 2021. Each colored section below represents the percentage of the population that was working, unemployed or out of the labor force that month, with rows delineating age groups and the sections within rows the work status of that age group.You can see that, as the years pass, the percentage of the boomer population that’s in the labor force declines. And, concomitantly, the percentage of all adults that is out of the labor force (indicated with a percentage in the upper right of each block) increases.If we animate those three months, two things become more apparent: the movement among boomers and the expansion of the overall population.That orange/boomer/working section keeps contracting. More of America’s largest generation are leaving the workforce.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementDemographers have long — as in, for decades — worried about how the arrival of baby boomers at retirement age would affect the job market. There are a lot of influences that change employment, of course, including things like global pandemics. But the decline in participation among baby boomers, however predicted, suggests that we’ve arrived at the point they were concerned about.The implications are serious. Will there be enough people to fill needed jobs? To pay taxes? It’s a detailed discussion that’s been underway for a long time. But it also affects things like unemployment rates in ways that mask this fundamental and destabilizing shift.",0,WashingtonPost
Could not be scraped,"Chicago Public Schools remained closed for a third day in a row Friday, after the Chicago Teachers Union told teachers not to show up amid disagreements about how to handle the coronavirus surge.And as the standoff continued, the punditry went to the predictable places it must always go in such circumstances: Bill Clinton and Sister Souljah! Ronald Reagan vs. the air traffic controllers union! Why doesn’t President Biden take a page out of those history books and stand up to a key constituency?2021 Election: Complete coverage and analysisArrowRightThese comparisons, as they often do, skip over all kinds of nuance and key differences — the biggest one being that the air traffic controllers were federal employees, and their strike was plainly illegal. Reagan had significantly more leverage than Biden does to get Chicago teachers back in classrooms.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementBut that doesn’t mean the administration is relegated to bystander status. And indeed, the situation is one of the biggest tests to date of the Democratic Party’s increasing efforts to assure they aren’t viewed as the party of lockdowns and school closures — particularly after they thought they had moved past the latter.It also comes as the administration and the party have very recent evidence of how damaging such perceptions can be at the ballot box; schools and extended school closures were a significant issue in the Virginia governor’s race, which the GOP won.You don’t have to look too far in the rearview to see both how difficult the situation could remain and how much the administration has struggled to deal with issues involving school reopenings and teachers unions.Story continues below advertisementBiden took office nearly a year ago having promised in his first 100 days to reopen schools, which had in many cases been closed for nearly a year. At the time, the sticking point was whether schools would reopen before all teachers were vaccinated, which the unions didn’t want to do. The administration offered decidedly mixed and at-times-testy messages.AdvertisementAfter the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Rochelle Walensky, signaled that schools could reopen without all teachers being vaccinated, the White House backed off. It claimed that Walensky had been speaking “in her personal capacity,” even as she said these things at an official White House briefing.Shortly thereafter, the White House demurred on whether it might have to get tough on the teachers unions if push came to shove. “I think that’s a little bit unfair how you pose that question,” press secretary Jen Psaki said — even as the suggestion had been made by a prominent Democrat, Mike Bloomberg. She instead offered noncommittal language stating that Biden wanted to reopen schools, but to do so safely.Story continues below advertisementWhen a reporter suggested this translated to “yes, with an asterisk,” Psaki shot back: “If you are the spokesperson for the White House, you could certainly say that, but you are not.”AdvertisementAs we noted at the time, it was hardly far-fetched to think push might indeed come to shove. Merely by edging back from Walensky’s comments, the White House was signaling that it wanted to avoid alienating the unions if at all possible. And while that was almost certainly smart politics, Biden had run his campaign with vows that he wouldn’t muzzle health officials like Donald Trump had, and that they would guide administration policy.Today, the White House is again declining to weigh in too forcefully, because it probably doesn’t have to — at least yet. White House coronavirus adviser Jeffrey Zients began an event Wednesday saying, “The president couldn’t be clearer: Schools in this country should remain open.” Psaki, too, has reinforced that this is Biden’s position, including tying it directly to the situation in Chicago, and has pointed out that 96 percent of schools are indeed open. The message seems to be: We’ve made good on this, even if there are outliers.Story continues below advertisementThe danger for the White House in Chicago isn’t so much what’s happening right now — though conservative media are certainly pushing hard to saddle the administration with it — but what might lie ahead. What if there’s a truly extended standoff there? What if teachers unions in other areas of the country begin taking a similar approach, especially if and when this unpredictable pandemic surges again — or stays surged? (Several other school districts have recently responded to the omicron variant surge by temporarily shuttering.)AdvertisementThere is certainly value in getting this resolved sooner than later. For now, the White House seems content to let Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot (D), who has clashed repeatedly with the same union in often-nasty terms, lead the charge. Lightfoot on Friday afternoon expressed some hope that a deal could be reached “in the next day or so,” but again blamed the union for the closures.Lightfoot is hardly alone in finding herself in such clashes. So, too, have California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D), New York Mayor Eric Adams (D) and plenty of others. Democrats as a whole have increasingly tried hard to avoid looking like covid mitigators.Story continues below advertisementArguably on no issue is the path forward on the coronavirus as politically dicey as when it comes to Democrats’ relationships with their longtime allies in the teachers unions. And arguably on no issue do they need to get this right as much as education. Not only did school closures appear to matter in Virginia, but polling has shown Republicans severely diminishing and sometimes erasing Democrats’ historical advantage on issues of education. CNN’s Harry Enten makes a compelling case that school closures have been a big part of that.AdvertisementIt’s quite possible to oversell the long-term salience of what’s happening in Chicago, particularly if it gets resolved after only a few days. But the lessons of the pandemic, the Democrats’ history with unions, and the 2021 election certainly indicate that there’s a premium on getting this one right and making sure school closures are as far from voters’ minds over the next 10 months as possible.",0,WashingtonPost

Could not be scraped,"There are few ways in which presidents are more obviously politicians than when it comes to economic data. There, every bit of good news is a testament to their savvy, sober helmsmanship, and every bit of bad news is some readily explained external factor beyond his ken. Former president Donald Trump was a robust adherent to this approach — on all things, really — but President Biden is hardly immune.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightConsider Biden’s assessment of Friday’s new jobs numbers, calculating employment in December 2021 — and putting a capstone on his first year in office.“We have added 6.4 million new jobs since January of last year. One year,” Biden summarized. “That’s one of — that’s the most jobs in any calendar year by any president in history.”Story continues below advertisementIt is. But that high number is high because of a low number and because of a higher number. But then, they are also probably better than they seem because they often start worse. Got it?Sign up for How To Read This Chart, a weekly data newsletter from Philip BumpI’ll start unpacking that description by putting it in its most appropriate context. There are now more than 330 million Americans, meaning that it’s a lot easier to put 6.4 million people to work than it would have been when the population was significantly lower. Trump used this trick, too, looking at raw employment totals relative to history because they sound more impressive.AdvertisementNonetheless, employment did expand quickly in Biden’s first year in office. The comparative growth in 2021 is clearly more robust in raw terms than it was for other new presidents in the past 40 years.Story continues below advertisementYou’ll notice, though, that the line for Biden begins below the line for Trump, unlike the other predecessor-successor pairings shown on the graph. This is a function of Trump having overseen a net loss of jobs during his presidency, which is itself a function of the coronavirus pandemic.This is important context for the job growth in 2021. Compared with where we might have been had the employment trend seen in 2018 and 2019 continued, the country is still more than 7 million jobs short of where we might have been. This happens, of course; the economy gets redirected and short-term trends don’t hold. Below, for example, you can see where we would be had the trends in 1985-1986 or 2005-2006 continued to the present.The recession a decade ago pushed us to a lower path. The question is whether the pandemic similarly shifts the path or, as with other dips, is simply a deviation from the pattern.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementWhatever the answer, there were a lot of people working two years ago who aren’t now, jobs that were then filled that currently aren’t. In 2021, the country was mostly refilling that hole, which helped push the number of “new” jobs higher more quickly. Employment in December was lower than in February 2020, meaning that there are also “old” jobs being filled and needing to be filled.That doesn’t change the fact that growth was good, of course. Relative to employment in January of a president’s first year, Biden saw faster growth both in raw and in percentage points. (I use January as a point of reference here because employment measured that month precedes the new president’s inauguration.)As I’ve written before, though, Biden’s also taken some political damage because of a weird pattern we’ve seen in the past year: The initial jobs reports have almost uniformly underestimated actual job gains in a month. On the graph below, note that the cumulative total of the initially released estimates in Biden’s first year lands just above 5 million, while the final, adjusted totals top 6 million.The difference in initial and final estimates seen in 2021 was larger than any other recent president except Bill Clinton. It may be larger still in the final estimate; the December numbers will be adjusted in January and February.In other words, while the economy has added a lot of jobs under Biden, jobs estimates have also often overestimated what the government tally would be, leading to a number of initial news reports that might later have been less dour. And then another caveat: Even with those revisions, monthly jobs totals have still been lower than what economists expected.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThere are a variety of other caveats that can be applied to jobs numbers, from the difference between the calculations of employment and unemployment and the fact that the December numbers were mostly counted before the surge in coronavirus infections that accompanied the omicron variant’s arrival. But even just within the context of the numbers we have, there are a variety of lenses through which they can and should be considered.For a politician, though, this is useful.

But on the 364th day, that became a problem.2021 Election: Complete coverage and analysisArrowRightInfluential elements on the right have been pushing since shortly after Jan. 6, 2021, to downplay the events — arguing that they had been blown out of proportion to tar Donald Trump’s supporters — and they came for Cruz hard after he invoked the t-word again Wednesday. So he backed off Thursday. He claimed he had been “sloppy” in his phrasing, even though he had used the word repeatedly, including months after Jan. 6.Much has been made about Cruz’s groveling appearance on Tucker Carlson’s show Thursday and what it says about power dynamics in the modern GOP. But their conversation was also notable for another reason: It demonstrated yet another attempt to retcon the Capitol riot using an utterly misleading presentation.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementInitially, the biggest example of this was arguing that it wasn’t an “insurrection.” (Never mind that GOP leaders and even Trump’s impeachment defense initially acknowledged it was exactly that, and that it obviously met that definition). Now, it involves arguing that it wasn’t terrorism.There is certainly a valid debate over whether Jan. 6 qualifies as terrorism — just not for the reasons laid out by Carlson and Cruz.After the two went back and forth for a while, with Cruz trying to back down but Carlson saying he didn’t believe Cruz’s explanation and that Cruz had “lied” about it being terrorism, they dived into the distinctions. Cruz said he had frequently described attacking police — as many Capitol rioters did — as terrorism, and that’s all he meant here.Story continues below advertisementLet’s set aside for the moment that Cruz’s previous comments invoking the word “terrorism” drew no such distinction; he used the phrase “terrorist attack” quite broadly to describe Jan. 6, in fact, just as he did Wednesday.AdvertisementWhat he described as the one actual example of terrorism doesn’t really fit — even as the attack could legally qualify as terrorism for a number of other reasons.A week after Jan. 6, and shortly after Cruz labeled the attack terrorism repeatedly, the Congressional Research Service issued a report on whether the rioters might have been engaged in terrorism. It cited two definitions:The Code of Federal Regulations: “The unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives.”The federal criminal code’s definition: “Acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State” that “appear to be intended … to intimidate or coerce a civilian population … to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion … or to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and … occur primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.”The CRS report is uncharacteristically definitive on this point, saying, “The participants’ actions seem to fit both definitions.” And they do. This was clearly intended to influence the work of a government using intimidation or coercion. It’s difficult to understand it as anything else.Story continues below advertisementWhere things get a little hairier — and where the conversation Thursday night on Fox News devolved — is when it comes to actual criminal charges involving terrorism.Advertisement“How many people have been charged with terrorism on January 6th?” Carlson asked Cruz. “Like, why did you use that word?”And the thing is, he’s kind of right: Nobody has been charged with terrorism for their Jan. 6 actions. But it’s also a straw man, because strictly speaking, domestic terrorism isn’t a chargeable crime — at least not by itself. Instead, it’s something that can be used to increase sentences for other crimes.Just a day before Cruz’s comments set the MAGA movement off, Politico’s Josh Gerstein dived into this question:Story continues below advertisementSeeking to satisfy a large swath of the public outraged by the Jan. 6 riot, prosecutors have declared that the event “certainly” qualifies as domestic terrorism. But they’ve kept their powder dry thus far on invoking the terrorism sentencing boost — potentially because its impact can be so severe....Invoking the terrorism enhancement typically adds about 15 years in prison to a defendant’s recommended sentence, sets the minimum calculation at 17 and a half years, and also flips the person charged into the criminal-history category used for serial offenders.While prosecutors have yet to actually call for the enhancement at a sentencing for a Capitol riot defendant, the terrorism-related provision is playing a significant role behind the scenes.At pretrial hearings, defense attorneys have indicated that they were unwilling to consider plea deals for their clients because prosecutors would not agree to refrain from seeking the domestic terrorism charges. In other cases, prosecutors seem to have dropped the enhancement, in exchange for cooperation from particular defendants.As Reuters reporter Brad Heath noted shortly after the Carlson-Cruz interview, despite the lack of attempts to increase sentences using the terrorism sentencing boost, prosecutors have used the word in more than 150 cases.Interestingly, as Gerstein noted in his prescient piece, the government has specified 57 crimes that can trigger a lengthier sentence if they qualify as domestic terrorism. But one that isn’t on the list is the one example Cruz highlighted — attacking police officers:AdvertisementAssaulting a police officer with a dangerous weapon, a potential 20-year felony, isn’t on the list. Nor is obstruction of an official proceeding, another 20-year felony, or interfering with police during civil disorder, a five-year felony.Many of the actual, potentially provable Jan. 6 crimes that could involve the terrorism sentencing boost are smaller crimes, including destruction or “depredation” of federal property. That leaves prosecutors with a decision about whether to threaten someone with many years in prison for breaking a window, for example — something that has come up in the context of Jan. 6 — if their intent was to intimidate or coerce the government.Story continues below advertisementThus far, prosecutors seem more content to use a potential terrorism sentencing boost as a bargaining chip than something they’ll actually pursue, for a whole host of reasons including how harsh such sentences can be.And that’s relatively par for the course, including when it comes to those who engaged in violent actions and protests during racial justice demonstrations and other politically tinged matters that could seemingly qualify under the definitions at the top.AdvertisementIt’s certainly a grayer area than whether Jan. 6 qualified as an “insurrection” — especially if nobody is ultimately sentenced with a domestic terrorism enhancement, and given the connotations that come with the label “terrorist.” Even Attorney General Merrick Garland, in his speech Wednesday, notably avoided the word.But as Cruz’s commentary demonstrated — even in backing off his terrorism labeling — one needn’t cite a sentence invoking terrorism (or even one that could plausibly be criminally proved as such) to regard something broader as terrorism, morally speaking. Cruz knew that for 364 days and seems to still know that, but the politics of it demanded a different approach.",0,WashingtonPost

He came to Capitol Hill with the reputation of a guy willing to be a burr under the saddles of the establishment. It quickly became apparent, though, that Cruz’s representation of the far right was more a function of tactical savvy than an innate connection to the far right’s energy stream.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightSo, entering the 2016 Republican presidential primaries, Cruz (R-Tex.) was quickly disadvantaged against Donald Trump. Trump had three advantages: He was an active participant in the right-wing media ecosystem, so he spoke its language fluently. He had a real objection to the political establishment that contrasted with Cruz’s efforts to leverage anti-establishment fervor in order to join it. And Trump acted on an instinct that Cruz didn’t have.Cruz has long prided himself on his debate skills, a confidence that is directly linked to a sense that you can convincingly make a case you don’t really believe. But trying to constantly calculate your ideal position leaves you vulnerable to overcorrection.Sign up for How To Read This Chart, a weekly data newsletter from Philip BumpWe come to Thursday night. Cruz appears on Tucker Carlson’s Fox News show to defend himself against criticism that Carlson leveled the night before: that Cruz was unduly harsh in labeling Jan. 6 Capitol riot participants as “terrorists.” The senator collapsed into sycophancy, trying to use his sharply honed debate skills to reframe his intent as surely as he tried, in the days before the riot, to both play to the far right’s fury and maintain some connection to reality. Again, though, his capacity for convincing others came up short.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAs The Post’s Aaron Blake documents, Cruz had used the same language repeatedly without much contention. After all, scores of people engaged in a violent, politically motivated attack on police officers, the sort of thing that, in other contexts, Fox News would describe in much more ferocious terms than “terrorist.” But in the year since the Capitol attack, the far right, like a murmuration of unsettled birds, has stretched its boundaries in describing the riot to demand that those arrested for it be considered political prisoners suffering at the hands of a fascist Democratic president.Carlson, who is far more fluent in the evolutions of opinion within that universe, has helped guide this new standard, arguing repeatedly that the Biden administration hopes to brand all conservatives as violent extremists. This is why he was going after Cruz, too: policing how the collective right unites in its discussion of what occurred.It’s worth stepping back and recognizing how weird this is. What happened on Jan. 6, 2021, was a staggering break from what we would expect to see in the wake of a presidential election and a stark warning about the ways in which American politics has shifted in recent years. In the hours after the attack occurred, there was broad consensus that it was unacceptable and beyond the pale. But, slowly and surely, the murmuration absorbed and reprocessed the events of the day.Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who gave an impassioned speech on the evening of Jan. 6 last year in which he apparently swore off his fealty to Trump, now again seeks the right’s warm embrace — or, at least, fears its icy rejection. Biden’s Thursday speech calling out Trump’s obvious role in spurring the attack became, in Graham’s formulation, a “brazen politicization” of the Capitol riot, as though the riot was a hurricane that swept into Washington without any intended political effect. The specific goal of that violence was to upend American democracy, something that is hard to consider outside the context of politics.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementI use the examples of Graham and Cruz here because they were central to the far right’s first major success in pulling the establishment to the right: Trump’s candidacy itself.In July 2015, Trump’s announced candidacy seemed like a joke. He had no experience, carried a ton of baggage that contrasted with the stated values of the conservative Republican base and simply parroted Breitbartian rhetoric about immigrants and Democrats. The establishment laughed at him and planned around him. Cruz and Graham both excoriated him as dangerous and dishonest. And then, on the strength of his ability to excite the fringe and mollify the moderates, Trump won.Graham and Cruz fell in line, gradually working their way back into the wary graces of the more vocal elements of their party’s base. Each later won reelection. But their navigation of the far right was like a novice kayaker in a Category 4 rapids — risky and unpleasant. When there appeared to be space to distance themselves from Trump after Jan. 6, each did so to some extent. And now they’re back.A decade ago, with the emergence of the tea party, the Republican establishment first started trying to corral the energy of the far right for its own purposes. As I’ve written before, Trump tipped the balance away from the establishment, pushing the GOP into a position of seeking rather than doling out the right’s power.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThough by now an important figurehead, Trump was always a vehicle for that power, not the embodiment of it. We see how that power is detached from him in more ways of late, from this policing about the fate of those arrested on Jan. 6 (a fight to which Trump was fairly late) to the backlash against his comments about being vaccinated. Trump’s voice has been diminished by his ouster from Twitter and the White House, and large parts of the right have moved on from him, often while still claiming to act in his name or to his benefit.Cruz’s supplication on Fox News was embarrassing to watch, an immediate manifestation of the transfer of power from the establishment to the vocal fringe. The rationale on Cruz’s end seems clear: He thinks maybe he can win the Republican presidential nomination sometime soon and so needs to keep that kayak afloat a bit longer.But we should recognize this particular embarrassment for what it was. Cruz and other Republicans are trying to navigate those rapids while still anchored at points to reality. And then, to extend the metaphor even further, they often risk drowning. The only way to do it is to float free until you reach the waterfall.",0,WashingtonPost

Could not be scraped,"On the anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol by a pro-Trump mob, President Biden pledged to defend democracy: “I will allow no one to place a dagger at the throat of democracy.”The next logical step, from his perspective, would be to pass legislation expanding voting access across the country. But to do that, Democrats need to erode the filibuster in the Senate. And to do that, they need to persuade Sens. Joe Manchin III (W.Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (Ariz.). Both have opposed changes to the filibuster, though Manchin has expressed a tiny bit of willingness to revisit it.2021 Election: Complete coverage and analysisArrowRightDemocratic leaders plan to ramp up their efforts to win over these senators starting next week. Biden plans to speak early next week on this, and Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) will hold a vote to change the filibuster by Martin Luther King Jr. Day.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementIf the filibuster stays intact (and Democrats don’t get voting rights legislation done), it will be because arguments like those from Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) prevailed. A group aligned with him is spending $1 million in ads in West Virginia pressuring Manchin to hold the line on the filibuster.So what are the arguments for and against keeping the filibuster? First, the arguments in favor of it:Why it should stay as is: The filibuster protects American democracyThe filibuster is a centuries-old tool that allows the minority party to block legislation even though it doesn’t have a majority of votes in the Senate. Its existence is a central difference between the House and the Senate. In the House, whichever party has the majority can do pretty much whatever it wants. In the Senate, you have to find consensus, since controversial legislation often requires 60 votes to pass, and rarely does one party have 60 out of 100 senators.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementConsensus, the Founding Fathers surmised, is a good thing for democracy.This is why Manchin urges caution about busting the filibuster. “The Founding Fathers understood that the challenges facing a rural or small state would always be very different from a more populous state,” he wrote in an op-ed last year. Some Senate Democrats privately agree with him on this front.Why the filibuster should stay as is: Eroding it could come back to bite DemocratsRepublicans are now this close to making abortion illegal in many states, and their success can be traced back to getting rid of the minority party’s filibuster to block Supreme Court picks.A few years ago, Democrats got rid of the filibuster for most presidential nominees. Republicans then took over the Senate majority and got rid of the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees. Then, under Trump, they molded the Supreme Court into the most conservative it has been in decades.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementSinema warns that if just 51 Senate votes can expand voting rights, 51 Senate votes when the Republicans next have control can make things worse, from Democrats’ perspective.She wrote in a June op-ed: “To those who want to eliminate the legislative filibuster to pass the For the People Act (voting-rights legislation I support and have co-sponsored), I would ask: Would it be good for our country if we did, only to see that legislation rescinded a few years from now and replaced by a nationwide voter-ID law or restrictions on voting by mail in federal elections, over the objections of the minority?”What is the filibuster?Why it should go: If not for voting rights, then what?Democrats and voting rights activists see Republican voting restrictions on key states as part of a larger effort to subvert the will of American voters based on the lie that Trump won the 2020 election. Democrats’ legislation to expand mail voting, make Election Day a holiday and curb partisan gerrymandering is their response.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAnd the 2022 midterms are nearing.“Our democracy is clearly imperiled. The lights are flashing and we are irresponsible if we don’t respond,” said Sen. Raphael G. Warnock (D-Ga.), a leading advocate for these voting rights changes.“If forced to choose between a Senate rule and democracy itself,” wrote Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) last year, “I know where I will come down.”Biden is starting to pick up this line of argument as he prepares to advocate more for this voting rights legislation: “If the only thing standing between getting voting rights legislation passed and not getting passed is the filibuster, I support making the exception of voting rights for the filibuster,” Biden told ABC News’s David Muir before Christmas.Why it should go: The filibuster is actually a blockade to democracyIn December, Democrats were struggling for the second time in two months to raise the debt ceiling to avoid a U.S. default and financial calamity. Republicans were using the filibuster to block this — even though most of them wanted to see the debt ceiling raised, too.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementSo Democrats made a deal with Republicans to allow a one-time exception to the filibuster to raise it. The process underscored for some Democrats that in these hyper-partisan times, the filibuster more often than not is a blockade to good governance.“If we can change the process on the debt ceiling,” said Sen. John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), “then surely we can do the same to protect our democracy.”“We must adapt,” Schumer said in a recent letter to his colleagues. “The Senate must evolve, like it has many times before.”And former president Barack Obama has tried to recast the filibuster as a racist tool. During the 2020 campaign, he cited its use to block civil rights legislation in the 1960s and called the filibuster “another Jim Crow relic.”",0,WashingtonPost

But it did provide an extremely apt picture of the current state of the post-Jan. 6 GOP — on the evening of the anniversary of Jan. 6, no less.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementCarlson began the interview by positing that Cruz had “lied” about the events being a terrorist attack. And Cruz instantly signaled contrition.“The way I phrased things yesterday — it was sloppy, and it was, frankly, dumb,” Cruz began.Carlson cut him off, though. He said he didn’t believe Cruz and that Cruz — a highly trained lawyer — couldn’t possibly have been so sloppy with his choice of words.“I don’t buy that,” Carlson said. “Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I don’t buy that.”The thing is: Carlson shouldn’t have bought it. This, after all, was hardly the first time Cruz had labeled Jan. 6 a terrorist attack. He did so Jan. 7, 2021 — “a despicable act of terrorism” — and in a Jan. 8, 2021, tweet. He did so in a local news interview published Jan. 8, as well.Story continues below advertisementEven more than four months after the riot, while voting against the creation of a bipartisan Jan. 6 commission, Cruz was still using that word. “The January 6 terrorist attack on the Capitol was a dark moment in our nation’s history,” Cruz’s May 28 statement began.AdvertisementThat is, indeed, a lot of slipping up to do — over a long time — for a Princeton- and Harvard-educated lawyer. Cruz’s sudden backtracking is pretty much a case in point in the GOP’s long-standing effort to disown its previous acknowledgments that Jan. 6 was as bad as it was — along with Donald Trump’s culpability. This wasn’t him slipping up; this was him deciding that the talking point was no longer welcome.Cruz continued to try to save the interview. He said he wasn’t talking about Trump supporters writ large or the peaceful protesters of Jan. 6. Of course, no one had argued that Cruz was talking about anyone other than those engaging in violence. And again, Carlson — whatever you think of him — rightfully cut in and said Cruz’s explanation didn’t make sense.Story continues below advertisementCruz proceeded to say that he has long labeled those who attack police officers as terrorists, and that’s merely what he was doing here. Carlson was again unimpressed and argued — again, validly! — that people who attack police officers should be put in jail, but that doesn’t make them terrorists.Domestic terrorism data shows extremist violence is on the rise in America. Here’s how lawmakers and the FBI are responding. (Sarah Hashemi, Monica Rodman, Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)Carlson then ventured on to some more characteristically shaky logical and rhetorical ground. He suggested that Cruz was playing into Trump critics’ hands by giving them license to apply words like “terrorist” to all Trump supporters.AdvertisementOn this point, he and Cruz reached something of an accord — albeit temporarily. Cruz acknowledged that part of the reason he was pulling an about-face on the T-word was because of “a year of Democrats and the media twisting words and trying to say that all of us are terrorists.”Story continues below advertisementThe solution to this is apparently to stop saying what Cruz really thinks — and something he has made clear he thinks on multiple occasions — about the people who attacked the Capitol.The accord just as quickly fell apart. Carlson argued that people had been distorting Jan. 6 for a long time, and Cruz — a focus of plenty of very early criticism for his leading role in objecting to the election results that day — would have known that as well as anyone. Which, if you accept Carlson’s premise, again makes a lot of sense.Advertisement“I guess I just don’t believe you,” Carlson said.The interview had it all. Here was the runner-up for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination appearing on the airwaves of a Jan. 6 conspiracy theorist, who instantly made clear who had the real power in their relationship. (Cruz even acknowledged that he sought out the interview shortly after seeing what Carlson had said Wednesday night.) Rather than truly defending himself, Cruz meekly tried to explain away his repeated comments, and that same host wasn’t having it. The host literally began the interview by calling Cruz a liar — repeatedly — and Cruz didn’t even directly dispute the premise.Story continues below advertisementThe end result was a U.S. senator who, as Carlson rightly notes, knows how to choose his words carefully and would have been well familiar with how such words could be supposedly misconstrued — including in this specific set of circumstances — effectively groveling and hoping to get a pass. That pass never arrived. But Cruz promoted the video on social media, anyway.The interview ultimately turned to friendlier topics, like speculating about whether a person present at the Capitol who was encouraging violence on Jan. 6 was an FBI informant — a hobbyhorse of Carlson’s that has often gone awry. Cruz concluded it by saying of the alleged efforts to tarnish Trump supporters, “I’m the one leading the fight in the Senate against this garbage.”If he wasn’t before, he surely is now — even if it means not saying what he really thinks and disowning what he said before.

There’s a smaller subset of members that have been identified who probably did more to encourage the ‘Stop the Steal’ part of coming to Washington.”Thompson did not elaborate on the committee’s findings, including whether the panel has information that these lawmakers had any knowledge about the possibility of violence on Jan. 6. But his comments during the interview suggested an intensifying focus on the activities of members of Congress in the days and hours before the protests began.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementDuring the broadcast conversation, Thompson reiterated his determination to seek information from members of Congress.  The committee has asked for interviews with Republican Reps. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Jim Jordan of Ohio. Both men have said they do not intend to cooperate.When Thompson was asked whether the committee would take the unusual step of issuing subpoenas for their cooperation, he said: “If we can get the necessary authorities and assurances that go with it, we’ll do it.

Bannon and former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows — have declined to cooperate with the panel, Thompson reiterated his view that the reluctant witnesses did not reflect the cooperation the committee has received overall.“We learn every day from patriotic Americans who come forward and tell us what they know” about the events of Jan. 6, he said. “And so we now know that [Trump’s] children encouraged him to try to stop it. We know that members of Congress, senators who contacted him.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThompson confirmed plans to conduct televised public hearings in prime time.“We think January 6 and what happened is so important, we need to give the greatest number of Americans an opportunity to see firsthand what we have uncovered,” he said, adding that he expected hearings to start within the next month or so and that hearings would likely be conducted on consecutive evenings.“So, I’m talking about like Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.

She said a gubernatorial candidate must have been a “resident within this state” for three years before the election.“The rules are the rules and they apply equally to all candidates for office in Oregon. I stand by the determination of the experts in the Oregon Elections Division that Mr. Kristof does not currently meet the Constitutional requirements to run or serve as Oregon Governor,” said Fagan, a fellow Democrat.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“As Oregon’s chief elections official, it is my responsibility to make sure all candidates on the statewide ballot are qualified to serve if elected,” she added. “The Oregon Elections Division and local election officials use the same standards to determine qualifications for hundreds of candidates in dozens of offices every year.

The law is clearly on our side. Our campaign will challenge this decision in court, and we will win,” he said.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementKristof faced several questions from reporters about his tax returns, which he said he will release in the spring.“We will indeed provide our tax returns, along with other candidates, later, as is traditional,” he said.He also criticized the decision on social media earlier Thursday.“A failing political establishment in Oregon has chosen to protect itself, rather than give voters a choice,” Kristof tweeted. “We will challenge this decision in court, and we are confident we will prevail, because the law is on our side.”According to Oregon Public Broadcasting, state elections director Deborah Scroggin sent a letter to Kristof on Thursday saying officials “did not make this decision lightly.”Story continues below advertisementAmong their reasons, officials noted that Kristof had voted as a New York resident and held a New York driver’s license from 2000 to 2020, Scroggin wrote. Though he owned and maintained homes in New York and Oregon, officials said he spent most of his time away from Oregon, she added.Advertisement“In order to satisfy the three-year residency requirement, you must have been a resident in Oregon for the entire three-year period beginning in November 2019,” Scroggin wrote. “But the objective facts, including your decision to vote in New York, convincingly suggest that you resided in New York at least from November 2019 to December 2020.”Last month, as news emerged that state election officials were questioning Kristof’s eligibility to run in Oregon, his campaign shared a Portland Tribune piece that argued that where Kristof registered to vote shouldn’t matter when determining his home.Story continues below advertisementIn launching his campaign, Kristof spoke of his roots in Yamhill, Ore., the opportunities he felt his Oregon upbringing had given him and the decline in prospects for those with whom he grew up.

Could not be scraped,"Throughout the first year of Joe Biden’s presidency, Donald Trump was the name that must not be spoken.As the former president solidified control over the Republican Party, spread lies about the 2020 election and teased another run for the White House in 2024, Democrats clamored for Biden to forcefully denounce Trump and use the power of his office to try to extinguish what they see as a singular threat to the future of the republic.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightBut Biden and his aides largely refused to talk about Trump or react to him, calculating that doing so might provoke Trump and risk elevating his standing by giving him and his rhetoric more media attention than they already have.Story continues below advertisementInside the White House, meanwhile, the president and his team strategized about when and how to break his silence. They decided to do so, finally, Thursday, as the nation paused to mark the first anniversary of the deadly attack on the Capitol.AdvertisementSpeaking from the Capitol’s iconic Statuary Hall, which last Jan. 6 had been overrun by violent pro-Trump rioters, Biden unburdened himself from the norms of presidential deference and unleashed a torrent of attacks against his immediate predecessor. Though he did not call out Trump by name, Biden made 16 references to the “former president,” whom he squarely blamed for undermining America’s democracy.“The former president of the United States of America has created and spread a web of lies about the 2020 election,” Biden said. “He’s done so because he values power over principle, because he sees his own interest as more important than his country’s interest and America’s interest, and because his bruised ego matters more to him than our democracy or our Constitution.”Story continues below advertisementBiden’s remarks do not mark a permanent shift in strategy about how to handle Trump, according to the president’s aides and allies. Rather, they said, Biden felt he had no choice but to directly address Trump’s culpability in the Capitol insurrection last Jan. 6 and the threat he poses to democracy.On Jan. 6, Congress marked one year since a pro-Trump mob attacked the Capitol. (Adriana Usero/The Washington Post)Advertisement“You can’t talk about what happened on January 6 without talking about the former president’s role in it,” Mike Donilon, a White House senior adviser, said in an interview. “There’s no way to be truthful about what happened there without doing that.”Biden and his team also calculated that his speech at Thursday’s remembrance event would draw maximum media attention. Indeed, all three broadcast networks as well as Fox News Channel, which does not consistently air Biden’s speeches, carried his remarks live.Story continues below advertisementWhite House officials considered a range of options for how to commemorate Jan. 6, including whether Biden would just release a statement or give a more formal address. Aides considered holding an event in the White House to honor law enforcement officials who defended the Capitol before ultimately settling on sending Biden and Vice President Harris to the Capitol for a formal address.AdvertisementBiden, who was deeply involved in the framing and writing of the speech, worked on it with advisers including Donilon; Jon Meacham, a historian who has advised Biden on messaging; and Vinay Reddy, the White House director of speechwriting.Even as he assailed his predecessor, Biden tried to maintain a modicum of deference. Asked by reporters why he did not refer to Trump by name, Biden explained, “I did not want to turn it into a contemporary political battle between me and the president. It’s way beyond that.”Story continues below advertisementAides said Biden only called Trump “the former president” because that is how he prefers to reference him. “He’s not inclined to talk about his predecessor by name,” said a senior White House official, who was only authorized to speak on the condition of anonymity.Biden also extended an olive branch to Republicans who have defied Trump’s calls to overturn the 2020 election results — such as Reps. Liz Cheney (Wyo.) and Adam Kinzinger (Ill.), both members of the House select committee investigating Jan. 6 —  calling them “courageous men and women.”Advertisement“Whatever my other disagreements are with Republicans who support the rule of law, and not the rule of a single man, I will always seek to work together with them to find shared solutions where possible,” he said. “Because when we have a shared belief in democracy, then anything is possible, anything.”Story continues below advertisementTrump had initially planned to hold a news conference Thursday at his Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida, but he canceled it abruptly. He said he plans to address the events of Jan. 6 at a rally in Arizona next weekend.Trump blasted Biden’s speech, suggesting the president was attempting to distract from the problems he has faced. Trump again falsely claimed Biden’s victory was “rigged,” although no evidence has been found of widespread voter fraud.“Biden is working hard to try and deflect the incompetent job he is doing, and has done, on the horrible Afghanistan withdrawal (surrender), the Borders, COVID, Inflation, loss of Energy Independence, and much more,” Trump said in a written statement. “Everything he touches turns to failure. That’s what you get when you have a rigged Election.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementMany Democrats have been restless, wanting to see Biden denounce Trump’s subversion of democracy sooner, more forcefully and with repetition.“I hope this moment does mark a turning point,” Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.) said after Biden spoke. “We need to talk about Donald Trump, what his presidency meant for this country.”Bush said Biden has a responsibility to use the bully pulpit of the presidency to speak out against Trump because more-vulnerable communities who have been active in protesting the former president are at risk from his agenda.“I look forward to seeing how he pushes harder in making sure that we know that the former president who has the power, the authority to really set the tone for what happens in this country and abroad, what he did, so that we can help to change that,” she said.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementBiden allies dismissed these concerns, however. House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.) said the president was at “his finest hour” on Thursday, arguing that it is best to criticize Trump directly only at specific moments.“I’ve heard people already, they tell me he should have given this speech six months ago,” he said. “Hell, no, he should not have. He should not have detracted from his infrastructure plan, from his rescue plan, from Build Back Better. That is putting too much of your emotions into this rather than dealing with political realities.”Many Democrats also want to see Biden’s rhetoric matched by action, particularly as it relates to voting rights. The president said the country must be “unyielding in our defense of the right to vote” on Thursday, and he and Harris are scheduled to travel to Atlanta next Tuesday to speak about the need to pass voting rights legislation that has been held up in the Senate.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementA coalition of voting rights groups in Georgia said Thursday that Biden and Harris should skip their trip to Atlanta unless they detail a concrete plan to pass voting rights legislation in Congress.Nsé Ufot, chief executive of the New Georgia Project Action Fund, which focuses on registering voters and was part of the effort warning Biden about his trip, said the president has fallen short of his campaign promise to fight anti-democratic efforts.“Not addressing this clear and present and direct threat on American elections is a fool’s errand,” she said. “It is a recipe for disaster. It is a concession and a pathway for Trump to return to the White House.”Ufot said Biden has not adequately confronted the Republican Party’s efforts to roll back access to voting.“What is happening in state legislatures across the country is dangerous and has the ability to destabilize government as we know it,” she said. “And I have yet to see the Biden administration act as if they understand the urgency of the moment that we‘re in.”AdvertisementWhen Biden launched his presidential campaign in 2019, his message centered squarely on Trump and the threat he and many Democrats believed the then-president posed to the nation. Biden castigated Trump for his response to the deadly 2017 white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville.As his campaign proceeded, Biden ratcheted up his rhetoric. He said Trump represented an “existential threat” to American democracy and later supported the House’s vote to impeach Trump for the first time by arguing Trump was “shooting holes in the Constitution.”Former Ohio governor John Kasich, a Republican who crossed party lines to endorse Biden in 2020 because of the Democrat’s unity message, said he has been let down by the president’s inability to fulfill that promise.“He ran as a conciliator, and he hasn’t been,” Kasich said. “End of story, and maybe he can change and become one.” He argued that Biden’s expansive liberal agenda has alienated large swaths of the country.Biden’s aides said Thursday’s speech was a continuation of the themes that compelled Biden to run, with the president even repeating the slogan that was at the center of his campaign.“I said it many times and it’s no more true or real than when we think about the events of January 6th: We are in a battle for the soul of America,” Biden said.Rep. Jamie B. Raskin (D-Md.), a member of the Jan. 6 select committee, said the threats to democracy extend beyond just Trump and now animate the Republican Party. Raskin said that Democrats, including Biden, must be clear about that.“He certainly needs to be the leader in our opposition to fascistic politics in America,” Raskin said of Biden. “He laid down the gauntlet in his original campaign when he said that he decided to run when he saw what was taking place in Charlottesville. It was prescient.”Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), who also sits on the Jan. 6 committee, said fellow Democrats should avoid amplifying Trump’s statements, but that the country cannot afford to fully ignore his words and actions. “If we look back years from now, having lost our democracy, people will wonder: How could we have missed such obvious signs?” he said. “How could we have missed him once again endorsing foreign leaders who are tearing down their democracies? And so as we‘ve seen so often in the past, when people tell you they’re going to do terrible things, you need to take them seriously, because particularly this former president is quite determined to do exactly that.”Biden made clear on Thursday that he agreed. “I will stand in this breach,” he said. “I will defend this nation and allow no one to place a dagger at the throat of democracy.”",0,WashingtonPost

A judge will consider the issue later this month.Defense lawyers made the request Wednesday, based on news articles that quoted one juror saying he used his past to convince others on the jury to believe Maxwell’s accusers, despite some gaps and inconsistencies.Story continues below advertisementPhotos included with some of the articles indicate the juror is a 35-year-old executive assistant in the finance sector who was referred to as Juror No. 50 during anonymous voir dire proceedings.AdvertisementMaxwell, 60, was found guilty on Dec. 29, after four women testified that she groomed and recruited them as teenagers to give sexualized massages to Epstein, and in some cases groped them herself.Ghislaine Maxwell, the longtime companion of Jeffrey Epstein, stands trial for sex trafficking of minors and conspiracy. Here's what to watch for in the case. (Joyce Koh/The Washington Post)The disclosure that Juror No. 50 was abused as a child would not have automatically disqualified him from serving on Maxwell’s jury. But the defense would have almost certainly used one of its challenges to dismiss him, had he made it past the 30-page, 50-question survey to voir dire, an interview process in open court.Story continues below advertisementProsecutors seek money from Boston Marathon bomber’s prison accountThe answers to the questionnaires are sealed, and jurors’ names have not been made public. It is unclear whether Juror No. 50 revealed his history of abuse when asked on the questionnaire if he or a friend or relative had ever “been the victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault?” In the transcript of his voir dire, however, he is not asked about his answer to the sexual abuse question, suggesting a disclosure had not been made.AdvertisementThe sexual abuse and sexual assault question on the survey was considered vital to the process of picking a fair panel in a high-profile case that centered on the abuse of underage victims. At issue now is whether Juror No. 50 omitted his own history from the questionnaire despite written and verbal warnings that he was under oath and was instructed to tell the truth.In the printed packets, jurors were warned — with capital letters and underlined notations — that they were sworn to provide truthful responses. The final page is a declaration requiring a signature to the fact that “under penalty of perjury” all of the above answers were truthful “to the best of my knowledge and belief.”Story continues below advertisementFormer federal prosecutors watching the matter unfold have said U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan has tough questions to consider, including whether what has transpired has resulted in a “material prejudice” against Maxwell that can only be cured by a trial do-over.Advertisement“This juror has no idea what kind of a chaotic chain reaction he has unleashed,” said Jason P.W. Halperin, a former prosecutor in the U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan, which handled the investigations of both Maxwell and Epstein prior to Epstein’s death by suicide while awaiting trial in August 2019.After written motions are filed in the coming weeks and Nathan “very likely” holds a hearing on the matter, “there is now a very real possibility that there will have to be a new trial,” Halperin added.New York AG seeks depositions from Ivanka Trump, Donald Trump Jr.In 2015, a federal appeals court in New York granted a new trial to a former Deutsche Bank broker in what was considered the biggest tax-fraud case in history on the grounds that a juror in the case lied about substantial matters in her background.Story continues below advertisementIn Maxwell’s case, voir dire spanned several days, and dozens of jurors were released from service based on their questionnaire answers. Juror No. 50, who could not be reached by The Washington Post, told Reuters that he didn’t recall being asked about sexual abuse history and that he breezed through the questionnaire.AdvertisementTodd Spodek, an attorney representing the juror, did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday. Spodek filed notice with the court that he was representing the juror on Wednesday, within hours of the U.S. attorney’s office bringing the juror’s comments to the judge’s attention and suggesting that Nathan appoint a lawyer for him. “The juror undoubtedly has exposure for perjury,” said Lindsay K. Gerdes, a former federal and state prosecutor who until recently served in the U.S. attorney’s office in Brooklyn. “That’s why not only did the government ask for an attorney to be appointed, the judge in fact agreed that was appropriate. And now this juror has decided to just retain their own attorney.”Story continues below advertisementGerdes said the legal issues at play in Maxwell’s case stand out. “Most of these motions [for a new trial] are dismissed out of hand. But this is one that is getting immediate attention and very well may have a positive outcome for the defendant here,” she added.AdvertisementJuror No. 50’s experience during voir dire was mostly unremarkable, according to the transcript. He was asked about his social media habits, replying that he had deleted his accounts “because I just got out of a relationship and I didn’t want to see anything regarding them.”Last week, however, he appeared to announce his participation on the jury in an Instagram post, calling it “an incredible, surreal experience and an honor to serve our country!” He also posted a selfie taken in front of the federal courthouse in early November in which he is playfully sticking out his tongue.How some states are trying to address racial disparities in juriesIn another twist that could influence the outcome of the future proceedings, a second juror told the New York Times they had also been abused and that their experience had played into deliberations, which lasted five full days and concluded in late December. As with Juror No. 50, it is not clear whether that person divulged the information on the questionnaire.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementMaxwell faces up to 65 years in prison based on her conviction. Her trial spanned four weeks and featured nearly 30 witnesses, including the four accusers, unfolding in pandemic conditions with the omicron variant bearing down.It would be both expensive and complicated to launch a new trial, and some legal observers said Thursday that they were skeptical that Nathan would order a redo.For one thing, they said, it is rare for a judge to overturn a conviction after making careful rulings and decisions to ensure a fair trial. Judges tend to be wary of wading too much into the jury process, which is secret and generally protected.Seth DuCharme, a former Justice Department official and former acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said precedent allows jurors some leniency but that jury conduct becomes improper when, for instance, a juror conceals having a personal relationship with a party in the case.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementOutside of egregious examples, “there’s a certain acceptance that jurors bring personal experience into deliberations,” DuCharme said.Juries are generally not attorneys and judges, so conversations in jury rooms are “amongst people that come from the community,” he added. “If you were going to disturb every jury verdict because somebody brought their own personal experience into that process, then you would have to disturb every jury verdict.”",0,WashingtonPost

Donald Trump urged supporters to come to Washington for a “wild protest,” the final stage of a plan to disqualify enough of Joe Biden’s swing-state electors to deny him the presidency. And what do Trump’s supporters say happened last year? Well. The riot at the Capitol was a “violent terrorist attack,” and the start of a Democratic “fear campaign” to “shut down free speech.” It was a “fedsurrection,” enabled by Trump’s enemies inside the FBI, carried out by “hundreds of thousands of patriots” acting righteously. It was a “normal tourist visit” that caused “minimal damage,” and should be celebrated like the storming of the Bastille. AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAll of this was, according to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), a “failed insurrection” that Trump was “morally responsible” for. To obsess over it, according to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, is to “smear anyone who ever supported Donald Trump.”When the smoke cleared on Jan. 6 — literal smoke, from tear gas fired at rioters by Capitol police — Democrats and some Republicans wondered if Trump had been discredited, too toxic to lead his party. That was naive. Even the Republican National Committee’s condemnation of the riots, as “an attack on our country and its founding principles,” left out Trump’s name.A year later, most Republicans continue to tell pollsters that the 2020 election was stolen. Many have adopted some version of an argument Trump began making nine months after Jan. 6, that the “real insurrection” was the election itself. AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“The former president and his supporters are trying to rewrite history,” President Biden said Thursday morning, kicking off a day of Jan. 6 commemorations that most Republicans skipped. Trump, he said, wanted Americans to see the riots as “the true expression of the will of the people,” and really, who were Americans supposed to believe?“Is that what you thought?” Biden asked. “Is that what you thought when you voted that day?  Taking part in an insurrection? Is that what you thought you were doing?”Democrats, who constantly ask themselves why they’re so bad at messaging, have won this argument with most voters. In November, while Republicans swept elections in Virginia and gained ground in New Jersey, their nominees condemned Jan. 6, and distanced themselves from the supporters who thought the “failed insurrection” was justified.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementBut the conservatives most ready to defend the Capitol rioters and insist that 2020 was stolen — including Trump — won the argument inside the party. According to a Suffolk poll released this week, while most registered voters agreed that “those who participated in the storming of the Capitol” were “criminals,” two-thirds of Republicans agreed with a different description: “They went too far, but they had a point.” A smaller share of Republicans, 11 percent, said the rioters had “acted appropriately.”True to the polling, most Republicans now talk about Jan. 6 as a story of left-wing overreach, which suggests they think the rioters did have a point. And they ask if liberals have given themselves a different set of rules. At least 10,000 people were arrested in last summer’s racial justice protests, from rioters to criminals taking advantage of the crowds to people arrested for civil disobedience. Democrats clearly had no problem heeding people who marched for policies they weren’t getting from the people they’d elected. Who were they to lecture people about democracy?“The natural tendency of the media is to sympathize with protesters, especially those bedeviling autocracies,” wrote Pat Buchanan, the elder statesman of Republican nationalism, in a February 2020 column. “The media are the self-anointed judges. They decide which riots are benign and which are malignant, which should receive an empathetic response, and which should end with every participant in prison.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementMost Republicans who’ve weighed in on the Jan. 6 aftermath have taken the same view, comparing what Democrats said was unthinkable and anti-democratic to protests they’d embraced or participated in. In a column for Fox News, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) even recast last summer’s protests in Washington as a moment when “rioters tried to storm the White House.” (Protesters dismantled a temporary fence around Lafayette Square but did not advance on the White House fence.) Republicans running in 2022, who say they’ll shut down the House’s Jan. 6 committee, now talk about turning the investigators loose on Democrats.“This entire sham trial is motivated by embarrassing political opponents, and ultimately passing a piece of legislation that will make Americans enemies of the state in their own country,” author and Ohio U.S. Senate candidate J.D. Vance said Monday. In power, said Vance, Republicans needed to “go on offense” and “subpoena the people who actually made it possible to set Americans on fire without suffering any consequences,” like left-wing political donor George Soros.Only a few of Trump's supporters defend the Jan. 6 participants themselves, but they do so confidently. The Biden-style liberal horror at what happened is seen, on the right, as the ultimate in cringey liberalism. In a February 2020 speech, with Rep. Paul A. Gosar (R-Ariz.) in the audience, right-wing activist Nick Fuentes called the Capitol “the seat [of] an evil empire,” reminiscing about how members of Congress “scurried into their underground tunnels” when Trump supporters barged in. In this view, Democrats who were trying to turn Jan. 6 into a shared national tragedy are attempting to hold back a tide of righteous opposition to a regime that dominates pop culture, media, academia and the federal government.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“The only course of action at this point is to be just as firm in our stance as the Left is,” wrote conservative podcaster Eric Lendrum in the nationalist magazine American Greatness last week. “We should go forward celebrating the events of that day as our Storming of the Bastille; a day where a symbol of the degeneration of our ruling class into total corruption and tyranny was challenged, and the elites were shown just what happens when millions of freedom-loving citizens finally grow sick and tired of a boot perpetually stomping on their necks.”Democrats tell one story about Jan. 6: It was a tragedy, the most destructive part of a plan to nullify the election, exploiting and ruining lives. Their critics are more scattered. In the run-up to Jan. 6 commemorations, Republicans couldn't agree on whether it was a good idea, or a historically awful one, for Trump to hold a news conference on the anniversary and counterprogram the Democrats. Trump ended up scrapping that idea, and promising to tackle the subject at a rally nine days later — as he had at every rally since the 2020 election was called against him.“When it comes to riots and revolutions, all depends on who writes the narrative of history,” Buchanan wrote last year. “It is the winners.”Reading list“Biden goes after Trump for lies and self-aggrandizement,” by Annie LinskeyAdvertisementStory continues below advertisementTalking about democracy, and seeing who's still listening.“We asked GOP Senate candidates if they would have backed Pa.’s 2020 election results.

Brenda Lawrence (D) became the 25th House Democrat to retire in this cycle. Three events were connected. The Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission, created by a 2018 ballot measure that Democrats supported, consisted of 13 people mandated to draw fair maps without partisan favor. The way that it did so worried some Black voter advocacy organizations, and even, eventually, the state's own civil rights department. Each set of maps, for the House delegation and the state legislature, reduced the number of majority-Black districts, while increasing the number of districts where Black people made up at least 40 percent of the population.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementIn November, a think tank at Michigan State University released a study that explained what the commissioners had done. A few weeks later, the Michigan Department of Civil Rights condemned the maps, warning that the plan would violate the Voting Rights Act's guidance on creating districts where racial minorities were the voting majority.According to the 2021 Census, around 14 percent of Michiganders are Black. The last set of maps, drawn by Republicans, created two majority-minority seats in and around Detroit, which meant in that 14 percent of the state's 14 House seats, most residents would be Black. The new map would leave just one majority-Black district in place, the 13th Congressional District, represented since 2019 by Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D). The 12th Congressional District, represented since 2015 by Lawrence, absorbed dozens of non-Black precincts, including the 90 percent White city of Livonia and the 42 percent Arab American city of Dearborn.Lawrence said in her Tuesday resignation announcement that her decision was not related to redistricting, but other Black legislators, in Lansing, had already been attacking the commission's work and laying out a case against it. On Monday, dozens of current and former legislators joined a lawsuit led by attorney Nabih Ayad designed, in his words, to “have the Michigan Supreme Court strike down the redistricting map as unconstitutional and a violation of the Voter Rights Act.” Former state representative Sherry Gay-Dagnogo, joining the lawsuit, asked how Detroit might have fared during the negotiations that ended the city's bankruptcy period if it had been represented by legislators from places like Livonia.“We could potentially have people representing our community who don't have our commitment to our city,” Gay-Dagnogo said. “Detroit deserves to have Black leadership.”Instead, for the first time since 1964, Detroit and Michigan could have no Black Democrats in Congress. Many Republicans are urging John James, a Black businessman and veteran who lost two close U.S. Senate races, to run for a new district that Donald Trump carried in 2020.Tlaib, who won a narrow primary victory in 2018 and faced a Black primary challenger in 2020, announced Wednesday that she would seek reelection from the new 12th District, which combines areas she's represented with Dearborn, which for the first time would have Arab American representation in Congress were she to win. That kicked off a scramble for the 13th District, where state Rep. Shri Thanedar (D), a wealthy Indian American chemist and businessman, spent more than $10 million on a failed run for governor and nearly half a million dollars to win his state legislative race. He carried the city of Detroit while losing the 2018 race, and won his 2020 race with just 35 percent of the vote, as multiple Black candidates split the Black electorate. Thanedar entered the race Wednesday, and so did Gay-Dagnogo.Ad watchStop Him Now, “Marshalling."" The debut ad from the new liberal PAC starts and ends with footage from Jan. 6, 2020, warning that voting for Republicans in 2022 will empower Trump's “army” of supporters who want to “return to power” by throwing out election results. “You want to risk a return to this?” a narrator asks, over footage of Capitol Police Officer Daniel Hodges being pinned between rioters and a revolving door.Friends of Dave McCormick Exploratory Committee, “Dave McCormick.” On Monday, McCormick officially hung up his CEO badge at Bridgewater Associates, preparing a run for Pennsylvania's open U.S. Senate seat. Days earlier, he introduced himself to potential voters with this spot, which tells the story of his father shipping a Christmas tree from Pennsylvania to Iraq when McCormick was serving in the 1991 Gulf War. “He somehow got that tree from our farm to that desert,” McCormick says. “From your home to that desert, Christmas is full of unexpected blessings.” McCormick's hedge fund career and stint in the Bush administration (during the 2008 financial crisis) aren't mentioned; he's referred to as a “businessman.”Conor Lamb for Senate, “Pennsylvania Democrat.” This is the first TV spot for the Democratic congressman's U.S. Senate campaign, and the first positive spot Democratic voters are seeing about their options in the May 17 primary. (The first ad, which ran nine months ago, was a negative radio spot hitting Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman.) “Our democracy was born here, as much in the coal mines as in the Constitution,” says Lamb, picking up the theme from the launch of his campaign last summer, describing “freedoms” at risk and then getting specific about which ones he means: The “right to vote,” the “right to organize and bargain,” and a few synonyms for both. McKinley for Congress, “Unethical.” West Virginia's member-on-member race, which pits Rep. Alex Mooney (R) against Rep. David McKinley (R), got an early intervention from Donald Trump. He endorsed Mooney, who'd opposed last year's bipartisan infrastructure package, over McKinley, who supported it. McKinley's opening argument against Mooney highlights an ethics investigation that wrapped up last summer, before the two of them were shoved into the same district, and calls him a “Maryland senator” – an accurate reference to the fact that Mooney represented western Maryland in the state legislature before moving to West Virginia to seek a safe House seat. That was a liability for Mooney in his first few elections, but no Democrat has filed to run against the winner of this May primary.You are reading The Trailer, the newsletter that brings the campaign trail to your inbox.Poll watchHow worried are you about the future of American democracy? (Suffolk, 1,000 registered voters)Very worried: 51%Somewhat worried: 32%Not very worried: 8%Not at all worried: 7%Democrats are the ones holding Jan. 6 commemorations, but Republicans are more likely to think that “democracy” is at risk. Eighty-six percent of Republicans in this poll say they're worried about “the future of American democracy,” and 61 percent say they're “very” worried. Just 47 percent of Democrats say they're “very” worried, along with just 40 percent who said, in response to another poll question, that they're worried about the “direction of the country.”It's not complicated: “Democracy” means different things to different people. In the same poll, 85 percent of Republicans say the country's democracy is “weaker than it was four years ago,” a statement only 59 percent of Democrats agree with, even as liberal groups say that electoral democracy has never been under greater threat. Most Republicans — 58 percent of them in this poll — insist that Biden did not legitimately win the election, and that opinion is incompatible with a rosy view of electoral democracy. While the pollsters didn't drill into the definition, conservatives often describe social media censorship as tyrannical and anti-democratic. That's another factor in these answers.RedistrictingKentucky. Republicans in Frankfort are moving ahead with new congressional maps that make only a few changes to the old lines, keeping a safe Democratic seat in Louisville intact while making Rep. Andy Barr (R) of Lexington a little safer. Both Barr's district and the Louisville-based 3rd Congressional District had been trending toward Democrats, and the Republican map removed Democratic precincts from Barr's 6th Congressional District by stretching the 1st Congressional District, which covers all of western Kentucky, across the state and into Frankfort.Kentucky is one of five states, including Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska and Tennessee, where Republicans control the redistricting process and could, if they chose, obliterate urban Democratic seats by splitting them into several districts. That didn't happen in Nebraska, where Republicans kept the Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District, which backed Biden in 2020, largely intact. It's also looking less likely to happen in Missouri, where instead of splitting up the Kansas City-based 5th Congressional District — a Democratic stronghold — the latest drafts would leave it intact.“Democrats are nuking about 15 Republican seats and only North Carolina, Ohio, Georgia, and Tennessee have the courage to fight back,” wrote Ryan Girdusky, the founder of the conservative 1776 PAC, as Kentucky Republicans rolled out the map. “Total cowards.” The “15” number is hyperbole. Illinois, so far, is the only state where Democrats have eliminated Republican districts, attempting to shrink the GOP delegation from five members to just three. But Republican majorities in Kansas and Tennessee could still split up the Democratic-trending districts currently covering Kansas City suburbs and greater Nashville.New Hampshire. As expected, the Republican-led House advanced a new map that replaces the state's two competitive House seats with one that's safe for Democrats and one that leans more toward the GOP. Democratic-trending seacoast towns and cities, like Portsmouth, were pulled out of the 1st Congressional District, represented by Rep. Chris Pappas (D), and added to the 2nd Congressional District, represented by Rep. Annie Kuster (D). So was Durham, home to the University of New Hampshire and plenty of Democratic votes. (Bernie Sanders held his final major rally before the 2020 New Hampshire primary at UNH's Whittemore Center.) Joe Biden carried this version of the 2nd District by a landslide: Donald Trump, who lost the old 1st District, easily carried the new one.In the statesOhio. After considerable wooing from local and national Democrats, Cincinnati City Council member Greg Landsman entered the race for the new 1st Congressional District, which narrowly went for Joe Biden in 2020. Republicans in Columbus, who'd split the city in their last map and kept Rep. Steve Chabot (R) safe, were prevented from doing that again by a 2018 ballot initiative that added new rules for redistricting.“For the first time, the entire city of Cincinnati is in this district,” Landsman told the Enquirer. “There are 100,000 new voters in this district that have never voted for Steve Chabot.”Democrats won an old version of the district in 2008, but Chabot regained it in 2010, and a new Republican majority added deep-red Warren County to make it safe for him. Republican losses in the suburbs made the seat competitive during Donald Trump's presidency, but Warren County kept it red. In 2010, Democratic nominee Kate Schroder won the Hamilton County part of the district, which includes most of Cincinnati, by a bit more than 18,000 votes. Chabot overwhelmed her with a 45,000-vote margin in Warren County, as Trump narrowly carried the district.California. Conservative commentator Larry Elder ruled out a 2022 run for governor, after sending mixed signals about whether he'd challenge Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) again — and whether he actually lost last September's recall election. (On Dec. 12, he asked Twitter followers whether or not he should run, adding that “according to an opinion survey, the majority of respondents believe that the 2021 recall election … was fraudulent.”)Instead of running in the June primary, Elder filed paperwork to create Elder for America, a PAC to aid Republican candidates down the ballot this year. “While I may not know what the future holds for me politically, our campaign’s ability to attract millions of votes and millions of dollars in a very short time demonstrates we have a message that resonates with Americans,” Elder said in a statement. “I believe we can put that to good use.”Michigan. The House seat shuffle continued this week, even as Black legislators took the state's new map to court. Paul Junge, a former local Fox anchor and Trump immigration official who lost a 2020 race against Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D), announced a move to the new 8th Congressional District. That district, most of it now represented by Rep. Dan Kildee (D) (who's running inside these new lines), backed Biden by two points last year, and has been shifting right as Democratic strength waned outside the cities of Flint and Saginaw.Pennsylvania. State Rep. Austin Davis entered the Democratic primary for lieutenant governor, standing beside Attorney General Josh Shapiro, who's running for governor with no primary challenge.“Austin is going to be at the table when we make big decisions,” Shapiro told reporters in Pittsburgh on Tuesday, adding that the Black legislator would “make history” if elected in November. Davis, elected four years ago at age 28, had worked with Shapiro on a headline-grabbing new database for reporting police misconduct.In some states, candidates for governor pick their own running mates; in Pennsylvania, both sides of the ticket run in their own primaries. Austin is entering the race just five months before the primary, and 11 months after state Rep. Bryan Sims declared his own campaign for lieutenant governor. Sims, the first openly gay man elected to the state legislature, has built an image as a take-no-prisoners liberal, condemned by some Republicans in 2019 after being filmed shouting at protesters outside an abortion clinic. Nevada. State Rep. Annie Black (R) entered the GOP primary in the 4th Congressional District, becoming at least the sixth congressional candidate who attended pro-Trump rallies in D.C. on Jan. 6, 2021.Iowa. Former state representative Mary Ann Hanusa (R) ended her bid for Congress to run for state auditor, giving Democrat Rob Sand his first opponent of 2022. Hanusa entered the race for the 3rd Congressional District when it still stretched from the Des Moines area to her Council Bluffs base. The new map draws a more compact district around the briskly growing city and its suburbs, cutting out Hanusa's home.Meet a PACWhat it's called: Stop Him Now.Who's behind it: Five longtime Democratic strategists who did not work on the 2020 Joe Biden campaign: Saul Shorr, Mandy Grunwald, Jimmy Siegel, Miriam Hess and Teddy Goff. In a joint interview, Shorr and Grunwald said the PAC came together after Democratic defeats in Virginia led to a quick conventional wisdom that running against Trump was a losing strategy.“We thought it was a mistake to walk away from this entire line of argument,” said Grunwald. “Other people are going to make sure there's a positive national message.”What it's doing: Running ads to tie Republican candidates this year to Donald Trump and his efforts to overturn the 2020 election and change voting and certification rules in key states ahead of 2024. In a four-page memo, the PAC's founders argue that “we can and we believe must create a national narrative on the negative side about who the Republican Party is and how it leads to more Donald Trump and more chaos and divisiveness — very scary thoughts to both our base and suburban voters.” Its first spot warns that “Republicans in '22 means Trump in '24.”That ad is running just two months after Virginia Democrats lost, narrowly, with nominees who warned that a Republican victory in 2021 would launch Trump's comeback. Shorr and Grunwald pointed to data from former governor Terry McAuliffe's campaign that showed “Trump” dominating when voters were asked what they didn't like about the Republican ticket, and emphasized that McAuliffe, while losing, turned out roughly 200,000 more voters than Gov. Ralph Northam (D) had in his victory four years earlier.“If Terry McAuliffe had won by a point instead of losing by a point, the need for Trump messaging would be obvious to everyone,” they argue in the memo. (The margin in Virginia was 1.9 points, or a bit more than 63,000 votes out of the 3.2 million cast in the race.) To motivate “soft Biden” voters, said Grunwald, the PAC would run ads designed to reach them, and to reach the majority of voters in swing states who disapprove of Trump.“If this guy gets back in, there aren't going to be any Rex Tillersons in the Cabinet,” said Shorr, referring to Trump's first secretary of state, who lasted less than a year in the job and went on to criticize his former boss. “Think about what he was willing to do in the first week of January last year. Look, I've got to say: I thought it was Kabuki theater, what he was doing after the election. I've have been shocked at the level at which it was for real.”Countdown… five days until the special election in Florida's 20th Congressional District… 40 days until school board recall elections in San Francisco… 54 days until the first 2022 primaries … 306 days until the midterm elections",0,WashingtonPost
Could not be scraped,"President Biden denounced his predecessor Thursday as a threat to the constitutional order at home and the democratic project abroad, using the first anniversary of the violent assault on the U.S. Capitol by Donald Trump’s supporters to rally support for the most basic precepts of the American system.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightThe remarkable condemnation of the former president was delivered in a building and a country that remains divided over the meaning of the mob attack intended to prevent Biden from taking office after his electoral victory. Biden spoke from Statuary Hall, where one year ago marauding protesters had broken in and set off battles with police for control of the seat of American democracy.Democrats spent the day recounting from the congressional chambers the terror they felt last year; Republicans, with few exceptions, avoided the proceedings. The current Republican congressional leadership did not participate, with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) traveling to Georgia for a funeral, and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) working outside of Washington.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementOnly a few Republican lawmakers issued condemnations of the year-old attack, while fringe members of the GOP tried to fill the void by staging a news conference to elevate unsubstantiated theories that federal agents may have secretly played a role in fomenting the rioters, who have been described by prosecutors and judges as Trump followers inspired by his rhetoric.Rather than suggest the country had learned from and begun to heal the wounds of the national trauma on Jan. 6, 2021, the day’s events underscored the fundamental challenges that remain. A chorus of national leaders issued statements of alarm about their doubts that the nation will be able to hold on to its founding vision in the coming years.“The former president of the United States of America has created and spread a web of lies about the 2020 election,” Biden said, breaking with his recent practice of declining comment on Trump. “He’s done so because he values power over principle, because he sees his own interests as more important than his country’s interests and America’s interests, and because his bruised ego matters more to him than our democracy or our Constitution.”It was a return to the themes that Biden successfully used in his presidential campaign, which cast Trump as a challenge to the “soul of America.” He addressed his remarks directly to American citizens, asking them repeatedly to reflect on their memories of the last election and the subsequent attack on the Capitol. Biden said the leaders of Russia and China, two prominent American rivals, are betting that “America is a place for the autocrat, the dictator, the strongman.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“We are living at an inflection point in history, both at home and abroad,” he said. “We’re engaged anew in a struggle between democracy and autocracy, between the aspirations of the many and the greed of the few, between the people’s right of self-determination and [the] self-seeking autocrat.”Biden’s claims were echoed by Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), who said Trump continues to “egg on the mob,” and by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who led a moment of silence on the House floor. They hosted a panel of presidential historians, who cast the challenge of last year’s attack in the context of other historic national trials, including the tenuous months in 1861 after the election of President Abraham Lincoln and before the start of the Civil War over slavery.Sen. Mitt Romney (Utah) was one of the few Republican lawmakers to offer a statement on the occasion. “Democracy is fragile,” he said in an implicit rebuke of those in his party who have sought to dismiss the impact of last year’s assault. “[I]t cannot survive without leaders of integrity and character who care more about the strength of our Republic than about winning the next election.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementRep. Liz Cheney (Wyo.) was the only Republican present on the House floor for a midday moment of silence to commemorate the officers who died in the aftermath of  the attack. She was joined by her father, former Republican vice president and congressman Richard B. Cheney, in a show of solidarity. Pelosi told reporters that Democrats were “very honored” by his decision to attend.“I think they are doing a hell of a job, and I am here to support it,” the elder Cheney told reporters about the commission, of which his daughter is a member, that is investigating  the Capitol attack, before criticizing Republican leaders of the House as being unlike those who led the chamber when he served in Congress.One of Cheney’s former political advisers, Karl Rove, also published an article Thursday in the Wall Street Journal, endorsing the congressional investigation into the attack and criticizing Republicans who have tried to move on prematurely.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“There can be no soft-pedaling what happened and no absolution for those who planned, encouraged and aided the attempt to overthrow our democracy,” he wrote.Democratic former presidents Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter also issued warnings timed with the anniversary of the Capitol attack.“The truth is that our democracy is at a greater risk today than it was back then,” Obama said. Clinton said the effort to undermine democracy had “only grown stronger over the last year.” Carter described American democracy as “dangerously fragile.”Trump, who had once planned to stage his own televised event on the anniversary, opted not to appear in public, bowing to concerns among some of his advisers that such an event would do him political harm. Instead, he released a statement after Biden spoke, falsely claiming that Biden had used his name, while repeating his untrue claim that the 2020 election was “rigged.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“This political theater is all just a distraction for the fact Biden has completely and totally failed,” Trump said in the statement.Two of his strongest allies in Washington, Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) and Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) held a news conference to show video clips of people who participated in the protests around the Capitol who had not yet been charged for their roles. They claimed, without specific evidence, that the people in question could have been working with federal authorities at the time of the attack.Before, during and after the Capitol insurrectionThe Jan. 6 attack, an effort to disrupt the certification of electoral votes awarding the presidency to Biden, took place after a rally near the White House, which had been organized after Trump called supporters to the city for a protest he promised “will be wild.” During the rally, Trump urged his followers to march to the Capitol.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementFive people, including a Capitol Police officer, died as a result of the riot, which injured about 140 members of law enforcement. Four other officers who were at the Capitol that day later died by suicide. As battles raged at the Capitol, Trump waited more than three hours, despite the urging of friends and advisers, to release a video that asked his supporters to go home.More than 725 participants in the riot have been charged by federal prosecutors, including more than 75 who were charged with using a deadly or dangerous weapon against police officers.In the year since the attack, a strong majority of Americans continue to side against the rioters who sacked the Capitol and favor congressional investigators seeking more information on the attack, despite persistent efforts by Trump and Republican leaders to defend the protests and undermine the probe.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementTwo recent public polls by news organizations have found that 62 percent and 71 percent of Americans support the investigation. About 6 in 10 Americans in multiple polls say Trump holds significant responsibility for the attack.“This is a moment in history where the videos don’t lie,” said John Anzalone, a Democratic pollster who works for Biden. “When you wake up in the morning and are watching Gayle King, and you are watching a police officer clubbed by a baseball bat, there is nothing partisan about it.”But a distinct minority of the country, including 62 percent of Republicans, continues to believe falsely that there is solid evidence of widespread election fraud. A smaller fraction of the Republican Party — 24 percent, according to a CBS News-YouGov poll — said they approved of those who forced their way into the U.S. Capitol.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe 1 in 3 Americans who believe Trump’s false claims about the election are also more likely to have a more forgiving view of political violence. In a recent Washington Post-University of Maryland poll, 45 percent of those who said they believe Biden’s election was not legitimate said violence against the government can be justified, compared to 30 percent among those who said they believe Biden was legitimately elected.Sen. Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Rep. Lofgren (D-Calif.) discuss what's being done to protect the U.S. Capitol after the Jan. 6 insurrection. (The Washington Post)Democratic election strategists broadly believe that the Jan. 6 attack and concerns over Trump’s potential return to power in 2024 will be assets in the coming midterm elections, where Democrats otherwise face steep headwinds from Biden’s low approval ratings and continued frustration over the federal government’s response to the covid-19 pandemic and the nation’s economic health.Three different Democratic groups — Priorities USA, the congressional Hispanic Caucus’s Bold PAC and a new group called Stop Him Now — announced small ad campaigns Wednesday that used violent images from the Jan. 6 attack to warn voters about a Republican return to power.“Every vote we take this November is a vote against Trump,” ran the tag line of the spot by Priorities USA Action, which the group said was backed by a symbolic investment of more than $100,000.Republican strategists are similarly wary of the midterms becoming a referendum on Trump or the attack on Jan. 6. They have encouraged Trump and the party’s candidates to focus on Biden’s performance as president. But several expressed the hope that the events of the day would not have a big impact on Republican odds.“Your typical voter looks at this and says, ‘This is Washington nonsense,’” said Jim McLaughlin, a Republican pollster who advises Trump. “ ‘What I care about is what is going to help my pocketbook, who is going to deal with crime, who is going to fight inflation.’ ”Elections aside, the day’s events made clear that few speakers were confident, one year after the assault on the Capitol, about the legacy it would leave the country.“It’s either a step on the way to the abyss,” historian Jon Meacham, a friend and informal adviser to Biden, said at the congressional discussion, which was attended by Schumer and Pelosi. “Or it is a call to arms, figuratively, for citizens to engage and say, ‘No, we are more important, the work we are about is more important than the will and the whim of a single man, or a single party, or a single interest.’ ”The day of commemoration ended with a candlelight vigil led by Democrats on the Capitol steps for the assault’s victims.Mike DeBonis contributed to this report.",0,WashingtonPost
Could not be scraped,"President Biden on Thursday decried the violent mob of Trump supporters who breached the Capitol a year ago, saying that “democracy was attacked” and urging Americans to ensure such an attack “never, never happens again.” Biden took direct aim at former president Donald Trump, who he said could not accept his loss and “created and spread a web of lies about the 2020 election.”In a searing speech — and his most direct challenge to Trump — Biden vowed to defend American democracy and said Jan. 6 represents not its end but rather a rebirth of “liberty and fair play.”“I did not seek this fight brought to this Capitol one year ago today, but I will not shrink from it, either. I will stand in this breach. I will defend this nation and allow no one to place a dagger at the throat of democracy,” Biden said.Democratic House leaders planned a full day of commemorative activities, including testimonials from lawmakers, commentary from historians and a prayer vigil. Senate and House Democrats delivered floor speeches about the day, recalling their fear of the invading mob. Both chambers held moments of silence. Nearly all Republicans were absent from the Capitol and did not participate in the events.Here’s what to know:Federal judges in D.C. have gone below the government recommendation in 49 out of 74 sentencings held for Capitol riot defendants one year after the attack, about two-thirds of the cases.Trump had planned to hold a news conference to mark the first anniversary of the Capitol attack but announced this week that he was canceling it.Senior Biden administration officials have concluded that the government’s Jan. 6 preparations were hampered by a lack of high-level information-sharing and a failure to anticipate how bad the day could be.Enduring images from Jan. 6 | What the Jan. 6 committee has done | The Attack: Before, During and After Lawmakers hold candlelight vigil on Capitol stepsReturn to menuBy Felicia Sonmez5:52 p.m.Link copiedLinkSeveral dozen lawmakers held a candlelight vigil on the steps of the Capitol Thursday night to commemorate the first anniversary of the insurrection.“We prayerfully mark one year since the insurrection and patriotically honor the heroes who defended the Capitol and our democracy that day,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said. “Let us all here join in a moment of silence in memory of those who lost their lives and sacrificed so much for our democracy that day.”The event was solemn and brief, lasting less than 10 minutes.

An evening virtual vigil was expected to draw prominent state Democrats, some of whom publicly recalled the harrowing events of the past 24 months, including armed protesters overwhelming the Michigan Capitol in Lansing.But there were also plans for celebrations. One titled “Insurrection Afterglow” was promoted by the Hillsdale County Republican Party, with ads announcing the participation of GOP gubernatorial candidate Ryan Kelley, a Trump supporter who was in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021.The planned party angered some state Democrats. “That’s wrong,” said state Sen. Erika Geiss, who represents parts of Wayne County, which is home to Detroit. “This was a day for somber reflection,'' she added, calling on citizens to speak out and “defend our democracy after we saw it defiled last year.’’Having experienced protests in Lansing and watched scenes of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot in Washington, Geiss said, she was moved to write an op-ed Thursday in the Detroit Free Press. It grimly predicted that such events will continue.“Unfortunately, this saga of sieges is not over,” she wrote, recalling armed protesters entering the Michigan Capitol in the spring of 2020.“What Michigan experienced in 2020 was a prelude to the Capitol Hill insurrection, itself a stark reminder of some of America’s ugliest moments,” she wrote. “Until these domestic terrorists are stopped, they will boldly continue.”AdvertisementUpdates continue below advertisementMother of Ashli Babbitt, pro-Trump rioter killed in attack, joins Greene outside Capitol on anniversaryReturn to menuBy Ellie Silverman4:44 p.m.Link copiedLinkThe mother of Ashli Babbitt, the pro-Trump rioter who was killed when she stormed the Capitol last January, joined Rep.

Lt. Michael Byrd, a 28-year veteran with the Capitol Police, fired a single shot at Babbitt, sending her tumbling backward onto the floor. Babbitt was hit in the shoulder and later died.Byrd said that he fired his gun that day as a “last resort” and that he was trying to protect about 60 to 80 House members and staffers who were sheltering beyond the glass doors of the Speaker’s Lobby outside the House chamber.Byrd later was cleared of criminal wrongdoing.Despite the findings, Babbitt has become something of a martyr to the far right, embraced by Trump, who called her family to offer his condolences over her death. Trump has brought Babbitt up in numerous statements and interviews, referring to her as “an innocent, wonderful, incredible woman.”AdvertisementUpdates continue below advertisementHouse Democrats feared they would not survive the attackReturn to menuBy Mariana Alfaro3:38 p.m.Link copiedLinkAs they shared Jan. 6 accounts, some House Democrats said they feared they wouldn’t make it out of the Capitol alive that day.“America does not yet know just how close we, the members here in this room today, our nation and our democracy came to our demise that terrifying day,” said Rep.

Pelosi said the gathering was intended to “establish a narrative of the day, to preserve the truth.”From the song, Pelosi highlighted the lyrics, “We’ll make it right for you/If we lay a strong enough foundation/We’ll pass it on to you,” and said Miranda’s “beautiful words” should be an inspiration to all.“Somehow the arts have a way of saying things in a way that connects that we cannot do in any other way, and that’s why I felt it was really important for us to have the arts lead us in this discussion,” Pelosi said.Historians Doris Kearns Goodwin and Jon Meacham then shared their thoughts on the attack.

Liz Cheney is one of two Republicans serving on the select committee investigating the attack.Schiff told the former vice president and onetime Wyoming congressman, “It’s good to see you again.”The elder Cheney, who rose through the ranks at the Capitol to be House Republican whip, told reporters he attended Thursday’s session to support his daughter. Asked about the current GOP leadership and Jan. 6, Cheney said, “It’s not a leadership that resembles any of the folks I knew when I was here for 10 years.”Several other Democrats, including Reps. Jim McGovern (Mass.) and Colin Allred (Tex.), also joined the huddle around the Cheneys. When presenting McGovern to the former vice president, Liz Cheney said, “This is my dad.” Other Democrats later joined the group.Pelosi said she “was happy to welcome him back and to congratulate him on the courage of his daughter.”Liz Cheney told reporters: “The future of the country is at stake right now, and there are moments when we all have to come together in order to defend the Constitution. … A party who is in thrall to a cult of personality is a party that is dangerous for the country.”The Cheneys appeared to be the only Republicans present in the House chamber.An emotional Leahy recalls escape from rioters during attackReturn to menuBy Mariana Alfaro12:05 p.m.Link copiedLinkOn the Senate floor, Sen.

Leahy was shocked.“I’ve never seen anything like this in the U.S. Senate,” Leahy said. “We saw a mob of Americans who . . . turned their back on our nation’s constitutional history. They were rejecting everything that made America great.”As officers rushed senators to a secure location, Leahy recalled how one grabbed him by the arm and said, “We’re going to watch out for you, Shamrock.”Leahy paused for a moment, emotional, before explaining that the moment stayed with him because “Shamrock” was the code name he received during the 2001 anthrax attacks, of which he was a target.Leahy lamented how many of Trump’s followers were “callously used as cannon fodder” and made to believe that they were acting like patriots.“The former president told them so, egged them on, and they believed him,” he said. “Meanwhile, he and so many of his cronies . . . have paid no price for their roles.

I mean, he’s her father, he was the vice president, but I think you saw the why because, first of all, we appreciated the fact that he’s here supporting his daughter in what is otherwise a very significant minority position in the Republican Party, which is, which is very sad.”AdvertisementThe former vice president’s embrace of Pelosi’s leadership on Jan. 6 matters is jarring for veterans of the Senate, where for eight years he served as the president of that chamber and frequently visited with GOP senators to plot strategy.Story continues below advertisementBack in 2004, at a time when Sen.

Could not be scraped,"Former president Donald Trump’s reaction to President Biden’s excoriation on Thursday morning of Trump’s role in the riot at the U.S. Capitol was precisely as you might expect. Or, I should say, each of the three separate reactions Trump offered was precisely as you might expect: rambling, furious, accusatory, dishonest.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightFor the purposes of this article, a look at how the pro-Trump galaxy of pundits and hangers-on enable his dishonest claims about the election, we’ll focus on the third of those three statements. It, more than the other two, centers on the falsehoods that spurred the riot at the Capitol in the first place: Trump’s ongoing and debunked insistences that the 2020 presidential election was stolen.The statement begins with a set of cherry-picked statistics about which president had won election with which states. Trump’s banged this drum often enough before that there’s no reason to reiterate them. Suffice it to say that, in a pattern with fewer than a few dozen precedents, there are still a lot of never-happened-befores that could still happen. Just because no president had previously won while losing Florida, Ohio and Iowa doesn’t mean that such a thing was impossible or that somehow Biden cheated. (Also, John F. Kennedy lost those states, but who’s counting.)Sign up for How To Read This Chart, a weekly data newsletter from Philip BumpWhat I’d like to focus on, though, is this claim from Trump, a new addition to his tired litany of falsities: “Where did all those votes show up from in Georgia, where it was just revealed they sold ballots for $10 a piece,” the statement reads.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementA remarkable allegation, centered on the idea that something new had been “revealed.” And, if you are immersed in the pro-Trump — or anti-anti-Trump — media world, you’ve probably already come across the claim.On Tuesday evening, the site Just the News, founded by former Hill writer John Solomon, reported that the state of Georgia had “launched an investigation into an allegation of systematic ballot harvesting during the state’s 2020 general election.” (If Solomon’s name seems familiar, it’s probably because he played a central role in elevating debunked claims about Hunter Biden’s business activity in Ukraine.) Just the News spoke with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who confirmed the report. Raffensperger’s office had received a tip from a watchdog organization, True the Vote, about ballots being gathered and submitted on behalf of voters, a process called “ballot harvesting” that is illegal in Georgia. Should this prove to be true, it would be a win for True the Vote, which last year ran a fundraising campaign on providing just this sort of evidence. (A lawsuit filed against True the Vote by a donor frustrated at the organization’s failure to prove fraud was dismissed in April.)The existence of the investigation got some traction on the right. The National Pulse (which, by way of explaining its politics, identified Stephen K. Bannon as its 2021 “Patriot of the Year”) picked up the Just the News story, prompting a spate of enthusiastic “now-we-got-’em” style replies on social media. The Federalist’s Mollie Hemingway, who’s made a career out of battling established media outlets to Trump’s benefit, shared an interview Raffensperger gave to a show produced by the right-wing Sinclair Broadcasting Group. Trump’s assertion about people being paid $10 is mentioned in that interview.I likely do not need to tell you why this claim got the attention it did from the people it did, but it’s nonetheless worth fleshing out.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementTrump’s statement in response to Biden’s speech included an inadvertently pertinent reference to the “web of lies” he endured during the Russia investigation. This, you will recall, was a situation in which Trump benefited from efforts by various allies, often including Hemingway, to shift the goal posts to bolster his false assertions. Then, his allies cobbled together an alternate narrative to explain how the investigation emerged and hyped every small correction or adjustment to the official story as evidence that the whole thing was a house of cards.After all, the play has long been not to prove Trump right, but to prove the left and the media wrong. So now, in a moment that Trump is focused on his false insistences about the 2020 election being stolen, his team gins up an effort to elevate anything even moderately dubious about how the election was conducted to similarly cut the official story and, in the eyes of his enthusiastic base, to bolster Trump’s nonsense.It’s really important to understand the shifting of the goal posts that’s happening here, just as they shifted in the Russia probe toward the more defensible narrative that his allies cobbled together. For nearly two years, Trump has been claiming that thousands or millions of illegal votes would be or had been cast, to Biden’s benefit and his detriment. Many Republicans, understanding that this claim is increasingly indefensible, moved the goal posts to suggest that changes to voting rules were the mechanism for fraud. Often, this was done with a wink, letting elected officials shout about “rampant fraud!!” to the furious base while quietly whispering to donors, “ . . . in the sense of dubious legislative efforts.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementHere we have the same shift. People unfamiliar with how elections work will see these outlets and individuals hyping this claim about harvesting and take away the intended message: Trump was right all along! But then you go just a smidgen deeper and see the reality. Solomon admitting that True the Vote “does not allege the ballots delivered by couriers were fraudulent.” Raffensperger, in the Sinclair interview, made that point explicitly.“Those are still lawful ballots,” he said, “but they’ve just been handled fraudulently with, obviously, the ballot harvesting.”In other words, this in no way undercuts the integrity of the vote count in Georgia even if, should it be proved, it might damage confidence in the process. Meanwhile, Hemingway does not appear to have shared the news that state investigators found only four examples of votes cast by dead people in Georgia in 2020 — a robust dismantling of a central point Trump made about fraud but one that neither aids Trump nor indicts the media.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementCollecting ballots on behalf of other people is limited under Georgia law, and anyone who might have done so possibly faces criminal prosecution. But there’s no evidence now that such an effort in any way affected the outcome in Georgia beyond potentially getting more legal ballots returned. This is not proof of a conspiracy to steal the election from Trump unless you believe that making it easier for Trump opponents to vote is stealing an election.Some Republicans do.This is how Trump gets away with it. There’s a massive ecosystem of his supporters looking to prove the elites — the left, the media — wrong and a cadre of opportunists eager to meet that demand. So this nascent investigation rapidly jumps from “some people might have violated state law when collecting ballots” to “see, Georgia was stolen from Trump and this is just the tip of the iceberg.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementPerhaps the most fascinating part of this is that the ecosystem chugs forward even without Trump at its center. His wan comment about people getting $10 per vote (itself a misleading claim, as barely needs to be mentioned) came after the story was already churning.

Could not be scraped,"MOSCOW — When the Taliban took over Kabul in August and many Afghans were clamoring to flee, Russian political influencer and self-styled action man Maksim Shugalei swept in. He was on a mission to promote the Kremlin’s interests. Oh, and also to undercut the United States wherever possible.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightShugalei, president of the Foundation for National Values Protection, which is under U.S. sanctions, flew to the Afghan capital hoping to forge close relations with the Taliban, which he describes as “civil people, very careful not to violate the rights of ordinary citizens.”The political sociologist — and the subject of a series of Russian action movies — swiftly got a meeting with Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid. He says he offered to arrange for humanitarian assistance and for Russian experts to help the Taliban government establish a television and media operation. He opened an office in October. He’s flown in twice and has another trip planned in January.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementShugalei and his group offer a window into how Russia’s foreign political-influence operations leverage private groups in a long-running battle against Western ideas. With the U.S. exit, Afghanistan is now a key target for the Kremlin to extend its influence, more than 30 years after the Soviet military left in defeat.“The first country which takes the risk and starts working with Taliban will get the privileges and economic benefits,” Shugalei explained to The Washington Post. “I told them that if you’re interested in media experts or other professionals, just give us terms of reference and statement of work.”The Foundation for National Values Protection, or FZNC, is funded by Yevgeniy Prigozhin, a St. Petersburg oligarch who has been added to a sanctions list by the United States. The U.S. Treasury says that Prigozhin funds the Internet Research Agency — the troll farm accused by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III of interfering in the 2016 presidential election by using fake social media accounts — and that he is believed to be the financier behind the mercenary group Wagner. Prigozhin has denied interfering in the election or having links to Wagner and did not respond to requests for comment.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAnalysts describe Prigozhin as a Kremlin proxy who projects Russian influence across the Middle East and Africa while pursuing his own commercial gain. The U.S. Treasury says his foundation is part of his “global disinformation network.” Prigozhin did not respond to a request for comment.“Shugalei” tells the story of Maksim Shugalei’s arrest, jailing and torture by a Libyan militia. Shugalei is on a mission to promote the Kremlin’s interests. (Foundation for National Values Protection (Russia))On Ukraine’s front, a real war overshadows worries about a possible future one with RussiaPrigozhin started out with hot dog stands in St. Petersburg in the 1990s, then set up restaurants and won deals to cater at the Kremlin and state contracts to provide meals for the military and schools. He chairs the board of trustees of the Patriot Media Group, which has partnership deals with 500 regional media outlets in Russia.FZNC calls itself “one of the leading think tanks in Russia, specializing in African topics.” Its mission, it says, is to fight Western media “fakes,” spread the “Russian ideology of goodness,” promote Russian interests and preserve traditional culture.Shugalei has carefully curated an image as Russia’s patriotic action man, shrugging off danger, swooping into African countries — and now Afghanistan — that have been abandoned by Washington. He battles U.S. efforts to plant democratic values, much as Soviet military advisers fought proxy wars against their U.S. counterparts during the Cold War.Shugalei is a key actor in Russia’s intricate, partly hidden influence network pumping out anti-Western propaganda. According to the U.S. Treasury, Prigozhin uses “a complex network of shell and front companies” to obscure his ownership of organizations. His influence networks, the Treasury says, include FZNC, “phony election monitoring missions” in Africa and “fraudulent” think tanks. Media linked to the oligarch broadcast interviews with this web of influencers, while Prigozhin and his associates denounce independent Russian journalists.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementIn September, Shugalei accused the independent online media group Mediazona of imposing “unacceptable Western and European values on our youth” and called on Russian authorities to take action. The government declared the media group a foreign agent.Patriot Media Group outlets cite politicians and bloggers extolling Shugalei’s courage. They air Shugalei commentaries every few days: The United Nations is destabilizing Libya. Olympics gymnastics judges were anti-Russian. Sudan’s military coup was “logical” and beneficial. France trained terrorists and stole natural resources in Mali. Transgender people “and other perverts” will never gain acceptance in Russia. The U.S. departure from Afghanistan caused “general jubilation.”Amid heightened tensions, Russia and U.S. make quiet breakthrough on staffing at Moscow embassyWith his craggy face and shorn head, Shugalei has swashbuckled his way across Africa, turning up in Madagascar, the Central African Republic and Sudan, offering political advice to politicians, and spending 20 months in a Tripoli jail with interpreter Samer Khasan Ali Sueifan.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe pair were arrested on a “research trip” to Libya in 2019 and accused of actions to undermine the nation’s interests after Shugalei met with Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, Moammar Gaddafi’s son.Amid a drive to get Shugalei released, a “true story” action movie series about his purported exploits was commissioned (though by whom has been hidden). “Shugalei” and “Shugalei 2,” both released in 2020 and promoted heavily by FZNC, tell the story of his arrest, jailing and torture by a Libyan militia.He was in jail when the movies were released and claims they saved his life and helped win his freedom in December 2020. The movies aired on Russian television and streaming sites, attracting more than 6 million views on YouTube. They have been translated into French, Arabic and Turkish.Story continues below advertisementThe third installment, “Shugalei the Return,” debuted in September, and now there’s talk of a fourth.Advertisement“Many are sure that the third film about the adventures of Maksim Shugalei will become part of the new cinematic universe about Russian superheroes,” according to a typical article in Narodnye Novosti, part of the Patriot Media Group.Shugalei told The Post that he met three times in 2019 with Gaddafi, and advised him to run in elections and unite the country.Gaddafi recently announced his candidacy in the presidential election, which was to have been held Dec. 24 but has been postponed with no new date announced. Despite his prison stint, Shugalei said he wanted to travel to Libya as an accredited election observer. He later said he was blocked from returning.Six ways Russia views Ukraine — and why each should worry the WestShugalei denies that Prigozhin controls FZNC. He says the organization is independent and the oligarch is not his only wealthy patron. “When we have mutual agreement on a certain project, then he helps us financially,” Shugalei said. “It’s his decision, and he is just one of many.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe oligarch paid Shugalei 18 million rubles — $245,000 — after his release, they both say. Prigozhin has called Shugalei “a hero, a most honest man and a selfless patriot of Russia.”“He helped us financially,” Shugalei said. “When we got back, we did not have any money at all. So he helped us and, of course, I’m very grateful to him.” He said he was tortured at Mitiga prison and feared he would spend at least five years there. The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights has reported torture, unlawful killing and poor conditions at the prison.Facebook in December 2020 removed hundreds of accounts that the Stanford Internet Observatory reported were associated with Prigozhin’s influence activities in Africa, Libya and Syria, many of them used to push for Shugalei’s release. It took down a page dedicated to promoting the Shugalei films. American actor Charlie Sheen recorded a kitchen video telling Shugalei “don’t give up” and that “freedom will come.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementSeven months after he was freed, Shugalei was back in Africa, conducting opinion polling in Sudan. He confirmed “cooperating” with Prigozhin in Africa but did not elaborate.“Unfortunately, Prigozhin’s name is very strongly demonized in the West and naturally he has a very negative attitude toward this fact,” Shugalei said. “He has been turned into some kind of a monster who conquers one African country after another.”In 2020, then Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin accused Prigozhin of using “an international network of supporters to spread his malign political and economic influence around the globe.” The Treasury Department has accused him of political interference in Africa and extraction of resources in the Central African Republic, where he has gold and diamond interests. U.N. experts have accused Wagner of executions, torture and violence in the Central African Republic.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementWhen Shugalei flew to Kabul in August, one of the first people he called was Prigozhin.“There’s excitement in Kabul. They kicked the cursed Americans out. The Americans are fleeing like rats, thinking the ship is sinking,” Prigozhin wrote on social media. “Max says that they are fleeing hysterically, grabbing things.”Shugalei said the FZNC operation in Kabul aimed to “help everyone who suffered from the American peddlers of democracy” and to expose “fake news.” He interviewed more than 100 people for a report citing people’s anger about the corruption of the previous government, he said, and their worries about the unfolding humanitarian crisis.“The Taliban is open for cooperation, and they really want to be recognized and want to work with other countries — any countries,” he said.Natasha Abbakumova contributed to this report.Read more:Libyans ousted a dictator, but an ensuing civil war has drawn in Russia, Turkey and others with a thirst for controlRussia’s ally in Libya is battered by defeats.

Could not be scraped,"ALMATY, Kazakhstan — For days, the streets of Kazakhstan’s largest city smelled of burned rubber tinged with the acrid stench of stun grenades. Inside their homes, people huddled, fed by rumors in an unnerving information vacuum from a cut Internet and limited mobile phone service — all accompanied by the steady pop of overnight gunfire.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightOn Monday afternoon, the Internet in Almaty came back — at least for a little while — as the smell of burned vehicles slowly dissipated. It was here that the most violent clashes amid Kazakhstan’s sweeping anti-government protests took place over the last week. Government officials said at least 164 people died during the demonstrations — and 103 of those fatalities were in Almaty.Nearly 8,000 people have been detained across the country, Kazakhstan’s Interior Ministry said Monday.The streets of Almaty showed the aftermath of ongoing protests with burned-out vehicles and broken glass on Jan. 7. (Reuters)Kazakhstan officials say 164 are dead in protests, country now ‘stabilized’Protests that started in Kazakhstan’s western regions last weekend because of a spike in energy prices morphed into a challenge of former president Nursultan Nazarbayev’s regime and spilled over into other parts of the country. Nazarbayev, the 81-year-old who ruled for three decades and maintained a “Father of the Nation” title that gave him sway behind the scenes, has not been seen in public since the demonstrations started.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementOn Monday, President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev said the events of the past week were an attempted coup d’etat and he would soon present proof to the international community.On Jan. 5, Tokayev called on the Collective Security Treaty Organization, a Russia-led military alliance, to send in “peacekeeping” forces to help “stabilize” Kazakhstan. The approximately 2,500 troops remain in the country but are expected to soon depart, Tokayev said. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Friday that the CSTO would not allow destabilizing “color revolutions.”Color revolutions refer to the popular uprisings in Eastern Europe during the 2000s that Russian officials say were organized by the West to topple Moscow-aligned governments.Story continues below advertisementTokayev and other officials in Kazakhstan’s government have repeatedly portrayed those who participated in the unrest as trained “terrorists,” in many cases from abroad. The government has not presented any evidence to substantiate those claims.Kazakh embassies emailed reporters from foreign news organizations on Monday morning with statements from the Foreign Ministry branding the international coverage of the crisis as “clearly superficial and one-sided.”“Currently, the law enforcement agencies and armed forces of Kazakhstan are confronting terrorists, not ‘peaceful protesters’ as some foreign media misrepresent it,” the ministry said in the statement, claiming, without evidence, that “the attackers include individuals who have military combat zone experience in the ranks of radical Islamist groups.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAfter the country declared a state of emergency Wednesday, foreign journalists were denied entrance into Kazakhstan, and the Internet blackout further limited the flow of information.Why is Kazakhstan claiming foreign links to the unrest? Here’s what we know.In Almaty, people are largely divided into two groups: those who praise the protesters for standing up to the government and those call them “bandits” damaging the city. There remains confusion and speculation as to how peaceful demonstrations escalated into violence — and whether it was intentionally stoked by armed militants who hijacked the uprising for unclear reasons.“There are two protests in Kazakhstan,” said Kassymkhan Kapparov, an activist with the Oyan, Qazaqstan (“Wake up, Kazakhstan”) civil rights group. “One was caused by a surge of price for [liquefied petroleum gas] in western Kazakhstan, which is a peaceful demonstration. And what we saw in Almaty is an attack of armed criminals on the city. We have no clue who are these people. Locals would never do such awful things.”During the unrest, the capital of Nur-Sultan at times only had Internet for one hour a day — precious time to check in with family members. In Almaty, even those brief windows didn’t exist, and citizens were encouraged to stay home as security forces conducted an “anti-terrorist operation” in the streets. During a nationally televised address on Friday, Tokayev issued a “shoot-to-kill” order — although many people didn’t know about it because their home televisions depended on Internet.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementWith no access to the outside world, people read books and played board games. Neighbors talked to one another. Phone calls within the country worked, and that’s when the rumors were exchanged — some as extreme as talk of foreign snipers targeting civilians on the street.A text message from the government told citizens that a handful of news websites were available despite the Internet blockade, so people checked those for updates. Still, it was unclear what information could be trusted.On Monday, some people had started to venture out of their homes into Almaty’s strangely deserted streets. Stores were closed for several days last week, meaning  it had been a challenge to get even basic food supplies. The few businesses that were open had long lines — and items such as bread, eggs, rice and flour were sold out. People relied on leftovers from their New Year’s celebrations.How the crisis in Kazakhstan went from fuel protests to a ‘shoot-to- kill’ order by the presidentAs the clashes abated and the smell of burning in the city slowly drifted away, the signs of the unrest were still everywhere. A part of the city hall building was set ablaze. Stores and restaurants across the city had broken windows. Some have been looted.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThere is worry that the original purpose of the protests will be lost amid the destruction and subsequent crackdown. Kazakhs say they have grown fed up with an authoritarian government that somehow isn’t able to translate the country’s immense wealth into an improved standard of living for anyone beyond a small circle of the elite.“I wanted the government to hear us,” said Ulan Maratuly, a 23-year-old food delivery courier who protested in Almaty on Jan. 4.“The authorities seem to have no idea how we live, how we survive with our small earnings as prices get higher and higher,” he said. “I work a lot every day and earn around $300 per month, spending all the money on food. Where do authorities waste all the money coming from oil exports?

But far from reopening, the country has returned to its harshest controls in two years, as it seeks to contain the highly contagious omicron variant.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightThe renewed lockdowns reflect official concerns about whether China’s vaccines can hold up against omicron, as well as the looming challenge of supplying the population with booster shots before the efficacy of their first two doses diminishes.Story continues below advertisementThe Sinopharm and Sinovac shots in widespread use in China are “inactivated virus” vaccines, a tried-and-true method that has the downside of a higher incidence of breakthrough infections. Chinese scientists say they are working to develop more-effective mRNA vaccines, but it remains unclear whether those can reach market.AdvertisementWhether China succeeds in developing more-effective vaccines will have implications not only for its own people but also for developing nations that rely on its vaccines. Malaysia’s health minister said this month that officials were studying whether a fourth booster shot may be necessary for residents originally vaccinated with Sinovac.The latest coronavirus variant has taken over as the dominant strain in the U.S. Here’s what we know about omicron. (Monica Rodman, Sarah Hashemi/The Washington Post)Tales of anguish emerge from China’s locked-down Xian, as hospital staffers are fired over woman’s treatmentFor now, China has returned to harsh and inflexible controls, including the lockdown of 13 million people in their homes in Xian, the city with the most severe outbreak. The measures have plunged Xian into logistical dysfunction, with some residents reporting they were struggling to obtain shipments of food. Several hospital officials in the city were fired after reports of a pregnant woman who lost her baby outside a hospital as she waited for a coronavirus test result to clear her entry.China is battling its highest number of coronavirus infections since the beginning of the pandemic. The number of officially reported cases remains minuscule, compared with that of many countries. But with top leaders touting a “covid zero” approach, local officials are under intense pressure to halt the spread before the Winter Olympics begin in Beijing next month. On Sunday, the city of Tianjin near the capital began mass testing of all its 14 million residents after two cases of the omicron variant were detected, according to state media. Residents stood in long lines bundled up against the cold to take the tests.Meanwhile, new data suggest decreased efficacy of China’s vaccines against omicron — unsurprisingly, as Western vaccines have also shown lower protection against the new variant. One study published Dec. 22 by researchers in Shanghai showed a “significant reduction” in efficacy of a Sinopharm booster shot against omicron than against an earlier variant of the virus.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementA Hong Kong study of China’s other leading vaccine, Sinovac’s CoronaVac, found that three doses were not enough to protect against infection from omicron.Then there was a much-discussed preprint study conducted by the Dominican Republic Ministry of Health and U.S. researchers, which suggested countries that started their vaccination drives with CoronaVac may be in a tight spot even if they switch to another booster. The study, which still needs to be verified by peer review, said two doses of Sinovac’s vaccine followed by a Pfizer booster shot produced similar levels of protection as two doses of the Pfizer vaccine, and was not enough to prevent omicron infection.“Our findings have immediate implications for multiples countries that previously used a two-dose regimen of CoronaVac,” the study’s authors wrote.Ravaged by delta outbreak, Southeast Asia shifts away from China’s vaccinesSingapore’s health minister, Ong Ye Kung, announced Wednesday that residents who had taken three shots of Sinopharm or Sinovac vaccines would need to get a fourth shot after five months. If they didn’t, their full vaccination status — which grants access to public spaces like malls and libraries — would be deemed to be lapsed.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementStill, a World Health Organization official said Tuesday that the Sinopharm and Sinovac vaccines provide some protection against severe illness, hospitalization and death from the omicron variant.Top Chinese officials are recommending a mix-and-match approach for booster shots, which they say will provide more protection than getting three shots of a single type of vaccine.“For those that were originally vaccinated with vaccine A and then receive a vaccine B booster, the results are better than those vaccinated under an ‘AA’ or ‘BB’ plan,” Gao Fu, director general of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, was quoted saying last month by the state-run China News Weekly.China’s researchers are continuing their efforts to develop vaccines that will be more effective against omicron, though it’s unclear how long it could take and whether they will succeed.The Chinese company CanSino said last month that a new inhalable vaccine that it is developing, when used as a booster, provides protection against omicron and is nearly as effective as its mRNA counterparts. Those claims have not been confirmed in a peer-reviewed study.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementMajor Chinese pharmaceutical companies, including Sinopharm and Sinovac, say they are working to create vaccines using mRNA technology, the more-effective type used by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.For now, China has returned to strict pandemic controls, with the Olympics set to begin in a month.

It gives the Serbian star a shot at breaking the record for men’s Grand Slam singles titles at the Melbourne tournament.As the judge ordered Djokovic released from a quarantine hotel for undocumented immigrants, however, attorneys representing the Australian government warned that the immigration minister was considering whether to re-cancel Djokovic’s visa, threatening a new showdown. Soon, crowds gathered in downtown Melbourne, chanting, “Novak, Novak!” and “Free Nole!” as dusk fell.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe judge’s ruling initially unleashed a wave of celebration among Djokovic supporters, scores of whom gathered in Melbourne’s Federation Square to dance and sing.But as false rumors began to circle that Djokovic has been redetained — something the government threatened to do on Monday — the celebration turned to anger.Several hundred Djokovic supporters, shouting, “Free Novak,” marched to the skyscraper where the tennis star had been brought earlier in the day to watch the online proceedings with his attorneys.When a car with tinted windows emerged from the parking garage, Djokovic supporters surrounded it and began to boo, curse and block the road. When the protesters got too close to the police officers ringing the car, the police began deploying pepper spray.Story continues below advertisementNovak Djokovic's supporters clashed with police on the streets of Melbourne on Jan. 10, after they swarmed a car believed to be carrying the tennis player. (Michael Miller/The Washington Post)Djokovic supporters reacted angrily, screaming obscenities. At least one unmasked man spit on officers, while several threw plastic water bottles, hitting at least two officers, one in the head. An officer pepper-sprayed in the chaos fell to the sidewalk as a colleague helped him wash out his eyes. A Djokovic supporter and his daughter were also pepper-sprayed, with the family washing their eyes out with milk.Advertisement“It’s crazy,” said the girl’s mother. “There were kids as young as five.”Police officers said they didn’t know whether Djokovic was in the car.‘Novak Djokovic is not a criminal’: Serbia and Australia trade volleys as tennis star remains held in hotelDjokovic’s attorneys had presented a forceful case against Australia’s treatment of the tennis star on Monday, at times appearing to draw agreement from the judge. But the government argued it had the right to turn away anyone who poses a potential health risk.Story continues below advertisementDjokovic, 34, had been held in Melbourne’s Park Hotel since Thursday after his visa was canceled upon his arrival in the country Wednesday night, when authorities rejected his request for an exemption from Australia’s requirement that visitors be vaccinated against the coronavirus. Djokovic appealed the decision, setting up Monday’s legal contest.The high-profile case captured headlines by pitting the steely Serb against Australia’s strict pandemic protocols. Djokovic’s family denounced his treatment, and Serbian and Australian officials traded criticism. The case transformed the unvaccinated sports star — a skeptic of coronavirus vaccines — into a lightning rod for the global vaccination debate.In the hearing, Djokovic’s attorney, Nick Wood, argued that the tennis player had provided the Australian government with all required documentation and then received a reply from the Department of Home Affairs saying his responses indicated he met the requirements of quarantine-free travel.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“What is someone in Mr. Djokovic’s position supposed to understand?” Wood asked. “Any reasonable person would understand, and he did understand, that he had ticked absolutely every box.”Read the documents in Djokovic's case against AustraliaKelly appeared to agree, noting that there had been a “back and forth” of information from various levels of government and that Djokovic’s medical exemption had been approved by two independent panels of specialists.“The point that I’m somewhat agitated about is, what more could this man have done,” he asked.The judge said he was perturbed by the treatment Djokovic received at the airport, saying Australian Border Force officials had “reneged” on an agreement to let the tennis player speak to his attorneys and tournament organizers.Story continues below advertisement“The transcript is replete with statements by Mr. Djokovic saying, ‘If you will let me talk to people, though you’ve taken my phone from me, I will try and get you what you want,’ ” Kelly said, not hiding his exasperation with the government’s handling of the case.        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Novak Djokovic (@djokernole)The government then briefly outlined its position. Lawyer Christopher Tran argued that Djokovic’s appeal — including the accusation that the tennis player was pressured to speak without his attorneys or tennis officials — was more of a challenge of the process than the outcome, which ultimately came down to the Australian government’s ability under the law to prohibit someone from entering the country to protect the health of the nation.Advertisement“That provision does not present a high bar,” he said.Story continues below advertisementBut Kelly said he had a “reservation” about that argument, suggesting that the treatment of the tennis player should be taken into account.Novak Djokovic’s legal team argued he was given a medical exemption to enter Australia unvaccinated because he contracted the illness in December 2021. (Reuters)When proceedings resumed after a lengthy break, Kelly delivered a flurry of commands. He overturned the government’s decision to cancel Djokovic’s visa, ordered his immediate release and instructed the government to return the tennis player’s passport and other belongings. He also ordered the government to pay Djokovic’s costs.‘Rules are rules’: Australia cancels Novak Djokovic’s visa amid vaccine exemption uproarThe government had conceded that its broken promise to allow Djokovic to talk to his lawyers and tennis officials at the airport was “unreasonable,” Kelly said.When Tran told the court that the minister for immigration would consider using his “personal power” to again cancel Djokovic’s visa, Kelly showed a flash of anger.“It would be fair to say I could have been something approaching incandescent if I discovered that for the first time in the later hours of this evening or the early hours of tomorrow,” he said, later warning that a ministerial cancellation of Djokovic’s visa would bar the athlete from the country for three years.The saga began last week when Djokovic posted on Instagram that he was “heading Down Under with an exemption permission.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe post sparked outrage in Australia, which has recently seen a sharp spike in coronavirus infections despite high vaccination rates. When Djokovic arrived at Melbourne’s airport, he was detained for eight hours overnight before being transferred to the Park Hotel, where asylum seekers are detained, until his appeal could be decided.In court documents filed ahead of Monday’s hearing, Djokovic’s attorneys argued his visa was not subject to any vaccination conditions and was improperly canceled. They also said the tennis star believed he had obtained the requisite medical exemption and that Australian immigration officials had signed off on quarantine-free entry.But federal officials insisted the exemption — based on Djokovic’s contracting the virus in December, according to court filings — applied only to the tournament and was not sufficient to enter the country.Novak Djokovic thought he’d aced Australian immigration. It now looks like a fault.On Sunday, the head of Tennis Australia blamed the situation on “contradictory information” received during months of communication with the federal government.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementDjokovic is not the only player caught up in the debacle. After detaining the Serb, the Australian Border Force also investigated whether others had entered the country using the same type of medical exemption. Officials then canceled the visas of a foreign official and Czech doubles player Renata Voracova, both of whom have since left.Within 90 minutes of the decision on Monday, scores of Djokovic’s supporters had gathered at Federation Square. As a drummer pounded on a marching band drum, two teenage girls draped in Serbian flags volleyed a tennis ball back and forth. It was game on for Djokovic and party on for his supporters.“It’s a special moment,” said Andrea Jovanovic, 34, as her daughter held a Serbian flag up to the evening sun.Nearby, a woman in her seventies dressed in traditional Balkan clothing stood beneath a parasol that said, “Not Anti-Vax, Pro Liberty.” Australian officials had made a mess of the situation, said the woman, who would give her name only as Zorica.Advertisement“They mixed the omelet, now they don’t know how to swallow it,” she said, using a sanitized version of a Serbian expression. Zorica said she had spent the past five days demonstrating in support of Djokovic, whose nickname the growing crowd now chanted: “Nole, Nole!”“He was the sacrificial lamb,” she said.Read more:‘Novak Djokovic is not a criminal’: Serbia and Australia trade volleys as tennis star remains held in hotelNovak Djokovic thought he’d aced Australian immigration.

But elsewhere in the West, the jab-less are increasingly becoming personae non gratae.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightThe omicron variant is exacting some of the highest infection rates of the pandemic, and the growing frustration of the vaccinated majority in the West against its unvaccinated minority is reaching a crescendo in some countries. Studies suggest omicron causes milder symptoms. Even so, the unvaccinated — at least those without valid medical reasons — are being blamed for overburdening hospitals by putting themselves, and society, at risk.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementIn Florida, for instance, Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) signed a law that barred companies and schools from insisting all their employees be vaccinated. Within the week, Disney halted its vaccine requirement for Walt Disney World workers.Compare that to the stance of French President Emmanuel Macron, who vowed in less-than-tactful language last week to make the life of the unvaccinated a living hell.Pushback from his political foes wasn’t enough to derail Macron’s plan to shrink the world of the unvaccinated. By an overwhelming 214-to-93 vote, the French parliament approved his bid to remove a loophole that had allowed the unvaccinated to get around French health restrictions on dining at cafes, riding trains and going to the movies by providing a negative coronavirus test.Story continues below advertisementNow, it’s take the jab, or sip your champagne at home.AdvertisementAt the same time, the world grew for the vaccinated in France. Self-isolation times for those with full vaccine doses who test positive, Macron’s government said, would drop from 10 days to seven on Monday, and five days with a negative test result.Macron’s explosive remarks — made ahead of an expected reelection bid in April — assumed a certain calculus: That a national tipping point had been reached against the perceived selfishness of the unvaccinated.After critics derided the crude language he deployed as unpresidential, Macron remained unbowed: “When some make from their freedom … a motto, not only do they put others’ lives at risk, but they are also curtailing others’ freedom.

But less than two days before she planned to die in October, a medical committee determined she no longer met the conditions and canceled the procedure. A judge eventually cleared the way for Sepúlveda to move forward.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightOn Saturday, the mother and devout Catholic died “according to her idea of autonomy and dignity,” her lawyers said in a statement from the firm representing her, the Laboratory of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (DescLAB). The procedure was carried out in Medellín without obstacles or barriers, they said.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“Martha left grateful to all of the people who accompanied and supported her, those who prayed for her and had words of empathy and love during these difficult months,” they said. “Martha’s legacy is built on the life stories and cases that over 29 years have reached the constitutional Court and have allowed Colombia to be one of the few countries in the world where death with dignity and euthanasia are a right of citizens.”Colombia was one of the first countries in the world to decriminalize euthanasia; its constitutional court recognized the right in 1997. But for many years, the country extended the right only to patients with a terminal prognosis of six months or less.She’s 51, a mother and a devout Catholic. She plans to die by euthanasia on Sunday.Sepúlveda suffered from the progressive neurological disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, known in the United States as Lou Gehrig’s disease. After she was diagnosed in November 2018, she began to lose control of the muscles in her legs, to live in constant pain and to fear a future that would only get worse. Euthanasia offered her an escape from further suffering, her family and lawyers said.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAlthough ALS is a fatal disease with no cure, patients can survive from two to 10 years or more, depending on how their conditions progress. When Sepúlveda first sought out euthanasia, her prognosis did not qualify as “terminal.”But in July, the country’s constitutional court ruled that the right applies not only to terminal patients but also to those with “intense physical or mental suffering from bodily injury or serious and incurable disease.” The decision allowed Sepúlveda to schedule her euthanasia for Oct. 10.As her story circulated in Colombian news in early October, her decision drew a rebuke from local church leaders. A member of the national bishops’ conference urged Sepúlveda to “calmly reflect” on her decision and invited Catholics to pray that God would grant her mercy.Story continues below advertisementThen, in an 11th-hour move, her euthanasia was abruptly canceled. The Colombian Institute of Pain, or Incodol, which had been scheduled to carry out the procedure, said Sepúlveda’s condition had improved between July and October. The committee found no evidence meeting the requirements of degenerative, progressive and incurable illness, according to an explanation from the committee that was provided to The Washington Post by Sepúlveda’s lawyer.AdvertisementCommittee members based their decision at least in part on media coverage of Sepúlveda, who appeared on television smiling and laughing as she dined at a local restaurant.DescLAB, the law firm representing her, described the move as “illegitimate and arbitrary,” and one that violated Sepúlveda’s right to a “dignified death.”Story continues below advertisementAfter the surprise decision, Sepúlveda and her family resolved to stay silent as her lawyers took her case to the courts. After her appeal, a judge from Medellín ruled on Oct. 27 that Sepúlveda was entitled to die by euthanasia.The judge confirmed that patients who endure intense physical or mental suffering — with diseases such as Lou Gehrig’s — are legally allowed to access euthanasia even if their prognosis is not terminal, and that Sepúlveda’s health provider was not justified in its denial of her request.AdvertisementThe judge highlighted the lack of a cure or a medical treatment to stop the progression of ALS and said Sepúlveda presented significant evidence that her functional motor abilities would only worsen over time.Story continues below advertisementNeither the Ministry of Health nor Sepúlveda’s health provider challenged the ruling, allowing Sepúlveda to reschedule her appointment.On Friday, a day before Sepúlveda’s death, a different Colombian patient became the first person without a terminal prognosis to die by euthanasia. The patient, a man in Cali named Victor Escobar, suffered from end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.“The fight to take control over the end of life continues and will not end until people in Colombia can access an assisted medical death according to their will and without barriers,” Sepúlveda’s lawyers said.AdvertisementFederico Redondo Sepúlveda, Martha’s only child, posted a photo on Twitter on Thursday, two days before his mother’s death. It shows him with his hand on his mother’s shoulder, both of them laughing.Before her death, Sepúlveda spoke about her Catholic faith and her belief that God would support her in her decision.Story continues below advertisement“I know that God is the owner of life,” she told Colombia’s Caracol News. “But God doesn’t want to see me suffer.”And on Saturday, in the hours after her death, Sepúlveda’s son and family members joined to celebrate Mass — just as his mother wanted.Read more:She was ready to die.

Could not be scraped,"Richard Leakey, a member a renowned family of fossil hunters in Kenya, who discovered skeletal remains that illuminated the study of human origins and became a best-selling author, television host and a powerful voice for the preservation of African wildlife, died Jan. 2 at his home in Kona Baridi in the Ngong Hills outside Nairobi. He was 77.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightThe death was confirmed by Trish Sewe, a spokeswoman from WildlifeDirect, an organization Mr. Leakey helped found to protect endangered animals. The cause was not disclosed.Mr. Leakey was a third-generation Kenyan descended from English missionaries who went to Africa in the 19th century. He spent most of his life in his native country and always considered himself Kenyan and, in a broader sense, African. When Kenya became independent from Britain in 1963, Mr. Leakey chose Kenyan citizenship. He spoke Swahili and other African languages.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementHis parents, Louis and Mary Leakey, were celebrated paleoanthropologists who had been searching for fossils in East Africa since the 1930s. Their discoveries of skulls and other remains in Tanzania’s Olduvai Gorge helped prove that human life first emerged in Africa.Mr. Leakey made his first fossil discovery at age 6 — the jawbone of an extinct giant pig — but throughout his youth he had no intention of following his parents’ profession. He quit school at 16, became a pilot and ran a safari business for a few years. But the lure of the fossil beds remained strong, and his discovery of a lower jaw from the genus Australopithecus, an early hominid, brought him back into the field.Mr. Leakey, whose training came from his parents, did not attend college or call himself a scientist.Story continues below advertisement“I’m not a biologist. I’m not an evolutionist,” he told an interviewer for the Current Biography reference work in 1995. “I’m a naturalist.”AdvertisementDuring a plane flight near the border of Kenya and Ethiopia in 1967, Mr. Leakey looked down and saw that the geological formation surrounding Lake Turkana (then called Lake Rudolf) could be a promising source of fossils. He did not tell his father about it until they were meeting officials of the National Geographic Society in Washington the next year. Mr. Leakey, then 23, asked for funding to begin exploring the site and received a generous grant.He and a group of fossil hunters known as the “hominid gang” began excavating at Lake Turkana and soon unearthed many remarkable artifacts — which led to a sense of competition with his father and a years-long rift.Story continues below advertisementMr. Leakey and his team found Stone Age tools almost 2 million years old, an Australopithecus skull and, in 1972, a 1.9 million-year-old skull from a large-brained species that was an ancestor of modern humans. The skull, which was known by its museum registration number of 1470, was eventually determined to belong to a new species, Homo rudolfensis.AdvertisementMr. Leakey showed the skull to his father, whose pride in his son’s discovery led to an immediate reconciliation. Louis Leakey died days later.The fossil record at Lake Turkana led Mr. Leakey to propose a theory that different forms of early human life did not necessarily succeed each other in a continuous line of evolutionary progress. Instead, he said there was evidence that at least three different kinds of early humans inhabited the same place at more or less the same time, from 1.5 million to 2.5 million years ago. The idea is now widely accepted by scientists, who believe four separate forms of early humans lived there.Story continues below advertisement“He made East Africa the central playing field for the study of human evolution,” Lawrence Martin, director of the Turkana Basin Institute, which Mr. Leakey co-founded in partnership with New York’s Stony Brook University, said in an online National Geographic obituary. “By good luck, good fortune, good organization, hard work, he really hit on a place that’s turned out to be the mother lode.”AdvertisementMr. Leakey outlined his ideas in several books, including the best-selling “Origins” (1977) and “People of the Lake” (1978), both written with Roger Lewin. Mr. Leakey, who was on the cover of Time magazine in 1977 and was the host of a popular BBC series, “The Making of Mankind,” initially broadcast in 1981, believed that the first links in the human evolutionary chain reached back more than 7 million years.In 1984, he and his team at Lake Turkana, led by paleontologist Kamoya Kimeu, found an almost complete skeleton of a boy, believed to be about 12, from the species Homo erectus. Dated at 1.5 million years old, it is the most complete skeleton ever found of an early human.Story continues below advertisementMr. Leakey described the thrill of discovering the skeleton in a 1992 book written with Lewin, “Origins Reconsidered”:“How very human he looked in that setting! It was a moving moment for me. … This was a deeper emotion, one derived from the broad sweep of prehistory that I am privileged to see in my work. I realized I was face to face with a link in the chain that joins me, today, with the earliest human ancestors, apelike creatures who lived perhaps 7.5 million years ago.”Richard Erskine Frere Leakey was born Dec. 19, 1944, in Nairobi, the second of three sons. (A sister died in infancy.)AdvertisementHe spent much of his childhood working alongside his parents. The family had close relationships with Kenya’s native Black populations, which once led Mr. Leakey’s White schoolmates to taunt him, lock him in a cage and urinate on him.Story continues below advertisementIn the mid-1960s, Mr. Leakey went to Britain with the aim of continuing his education, but he ran out of money and returned to Kenya with the equivalent of a high school diploma. In addition to his field research and other projects, he began working for the National Museums of Kenya in 1968. He became the director six years later and was instrumental in making Kenya’s museums of science and culture among the best in Africa. He issued a ruling that all artifacts unearthed in Kenya had to remain in the country.In 1989, Mr. Leakey was put in charge of the Kenya Wildlife Service, with the aim of reducing the poaching of wild animals, particularly elephants and rhinoceroses. Mr. Leakey persuaded the World Bank and other international donors to give $150 million to the country to improve animal conservation. He organized the burning of Kenya’s 12-ton stockpile of seized ivory to prevent it from being sold. President Daniel arap Moi gave park rangers the authority to shoot poachers on sight. Mr. Leakey resigned from the post in 1994, after disagreements with political leaders.AdvertisementBlunt and outspoken, Mr. Leakey did not shrink from disagreements with scientists, political opponents or even members of his family. He kept a loaded gun in his briefcase.Story continues below advertisement“When I was head of the Kenya Wildlife Service I had five bodyguards, night and day, 24/7,” Mr. Leakey told Newsweek in 2014. “And I needed them. There were many, shall we say, interesting incidents.”Mr. Leakey’s first marriage, to Margaret Cropper, ended in divorce. Survivors include his wife since 1970, the former Meave Epps, a paleoanthropologist who has made significant discoveries of her own; a daughter from his first marriage; two daughters from his second marriage; two brothers; and three grandchildren.Throughout his life, Mr. Leakey was prone to illness and mishaps, beginning with a fractured skull in his youth. He developed an infection that led to chronic kidney disease and had two kidney transplants, including one in 1979 from a brother, Philip, from whom he had been estranged for 10 years. (Philip Leakey was the first White person elected to Kenya’s Parliament.)AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementIn 1993, Mr. Leakey crashed his single-engine airplane — he suspected sabotage — resulting in the amputation of both legs below the knee. He learned to walk on prosthetics within weeks. After years in the sun, he developed many cancerous lesions that had to be removed. He had a liver transplant in 2013.In the mid-1990s, Mr. Leakey helped form a new political party called Safina (Swahili for “Noah’s ark”) to challenge what he viewed as Kenya’s corrupt political leadership. He was attacked in the street by thugs with whips and clubs, but he was nevertheless elected to Parliament, along with several other members of his party.He was named head of Kenya’s civil service in 1999, only to resign after two years because of political interference. From 2002 to 2015, Mr. Leakey divided his time between Kenya and New York, where he was an anthropology professor at Stony Brook University on Long Island and led the Turkana Basin Institute.He returned permanently to Kenya in 2015, serving as chairman of the country’s wildlife service for three years and raising money for a proposed museum on human origins.“I’m determined,” he said in 1996, “not to end up a frail old man in a wheelchair who’s done nothing and so has nothing worthwhile to look back on.”Emily Langer contributed to this report.",0,WashingtonPost

Could not be scraped,"MOSCOW — To Russian President Vladimir Putin, the collapse of the Soviet Union “was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century.”He made that statement in 2005, just months after Ukrainians launched their “Orange Revolution” and began to shake off Russia’s influence in the country, spurring Kyiv’s pro-democracy leanings. Two years earlier, an uprising in the Caucasus country of Georgia had ousted its Soviet-holdover president.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightPutin dreams of a Russian 'sphere of influence.' Kazakhstan's protesters are the latest to push back.Although Putin clings to Soviet nostalgia — and to a self-drawn map of Moscow’s “sphere of influence” that covers much of the former empire — the countries surrounding Russia have other ideas. The latest example is sweeping anti-government protests in Kazakhstan that have rattled a political system entrenched for three decades and brought in Russian-led forces to try to keep a lid on the unrest.Putin has long accused the West of trying to curtail Moscow’s reach. Now, he is portraying Russia as more threatened than ever and is demanding guarantees from the United States and NATO that the military alliance will stay out of what he considers the Kremlin’s turf, and he has called for the removal of NATO infrastructure installed in Eastern Europe after 1997.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementNATO has said Moscow can never dictate the alliance’s future. But negotiations between Russian and U.S. envoys begin Monday in Geneva in efforts to close the divide and cool tensions over Ukraine, near whose eastern border Russia has massed military forces.In early December, U.S. intelligence agencies warned that Russia was planning a massive military invasion of Ukraine. Here’s why Moscow would do that. (Jason Aldag/The Washington Post)U.S. plans to discuss missile deployments with Russia as part of effort to defuse Ukraine crisisFor Putin, the wider goals are to rework the consequences of the Soviet Union’s demise in 1991 — what Putin last month called “a disintegration of historical Russia.” But 30 years on, the generation rising into power in those countries do not share Putin’s romanticism of the Soviet Union, in part because they never lived it.In western Kazakhstan — where protests started over steep fuel price increases — some demonstrators chanted “Old man, go!” in reference to 81-year-old Nursultan Nazarbayev, who was the country’s president from the collapse of the Soviet Union until 2019 but remains de facto ruler. In 2020 in Belarus, crowds rising up against President Alexander Lukashenko, who has been in power since 1994, chanted: “Leave! Leave!”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“Moscow’s talks about spheres of influence rarely correspond to reality,” said Gleb Pavlovsky, a former top adviser to Putin.“But these are dreams that of course affect the behavior of the Kremlin,” he added.A Russian-led security alliance landed in Kazakhstan on Jan. 6 to help quell violent and deadly anti-government protests. (Reuters)Russia’s rifts with the West keep growing. How did we get here?From Ukraine to Georgia to Armenia to Belarus to Kazakhstan, a popular revolt has at some point demanded the end of each country’s Soviet-era legacy and leadership. And the challenge to authoritarian regimes in Putin’s backyard is seen by the Kremlin as a challenge to him and the system he has installed in Moscow.The protests in Kazakhstan have proved to be a pivotal moment. Putin could not risk having the unrest bring in a new government unfavorable to Moscow, analysts say. So he opted to intervene, deploying troops as part of a Russian-led regional military alliance to help quell the protests. Propping up Kazakhstan’s regime also appears to be a longer-term play for Putin: to build even deeper loyalty to Moscow and to curb the influence of China’s growing investments and the West’s overtures for closer ties.‘Privileged sphere’In April 2009, President Barack Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev had a first face-to-face meeting on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in London. Medvedev had ascended to the presidency because Putin had just served out the maximum two consecutive terms in that office. Yet Putin, then Russia’s prime minister, was still largely running things.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementIt was during that meeting that Medvedev cited Moscow’s “privileged sphere of influence” amid Russia’s push for Kyrgyzstan, a former Soviet republic in Central Asia, to close a U.S. military air base at Manas, said Michael McFaul, who became the Obama administration’s ambassador to Russia two years later.“Obama told him, ‘I don’t get this privileged spheres of influence stuff,’” McFaul said. (The Manas base was closed in 2014.)Washington has continued to push back on the concept of a sphere of influence — which is at the center of the upcoming talks between the United States and Russia. Moscow has posted more than 100,000 troops near its border with Ukraine in an obvious threat to re-invade the country nearly eight years after its illegal annexation of Crimea and the beginning of Kyiv’s war with Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.On Ukraine’s front, a real war overshadows worries about a possible future one with RussiaPutin’s end-of-year news conference on Dec. 23 was a lesson in how he views Russia’s geostrategic family. He said that in 1991, “we divided ourselves into 12.” The Soviet Union was made up of 15 states. But Putin, probably on purpose, excluded the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania — all European Union members that turned away from Russia years ago.The other 11 countries of the former Soviet Union — Eastern Europe’s Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova, the Caucasus’s Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan and Central Asia’s Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan — all get different treatment from Russia.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe ones seen as loyal are rewarded with economic support such as loans, investment contracts and discounts on energy imports, or even the promise of military assistance. But Moscow also wants some things in return — limiting cooperation with the West and keeping alive the Russian language in those countries, for example.The Kremlin playbook for how to handle the countries that push back against Moscow — such as Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia — has included backing pro-Russian separatists that have carved out breakaway territories. Moscow has denied instigating those conflicts.“Putin thinks as a kind of 18th-century or 19th-century leader about spheres of influence — most certainly that was the case when I was in the room with him, and that’s been there for a while,” McFaul said.Story continues below advertisement“His ambitions are bigger than just his own neighborhood,” he added. “Putin thinks of himself as a leader of a kind of nationalist Orthodox conservative movement fighting the decadent, liberal and multilateral West. That has grown over time without question.”‘Midlife crisis’Kazakhstan’s Nazarbayev was considered the lone leader in the region who could say no to Putin.AdvertisementTwelve years Putin’s senior and a Soviet legacy, Nazarbayev had Putin’s admiration. Many even speculated that Putin might try to follow Nazarbayev’s example of how to continue ruling even after officially relinquishing the presidency. Nazarbayev handpicked his successor and took on a “leader of the nation” title that has allowed him largely still to call the shots.Then, on Jan. 5, Kazakh protesters pulled down a statue of Nazarbayev — an act analysts say was a chilling development for Putin.“I think any time where autocrats are at risk of being overthrown by their own citizens and through the streets, I think Putin views that as a direct threat to his own survival and the survival of his regime,” said Andrea Kendall-Taylor, a Russia expert at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington-based think tank.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementPutin has a history of supporting authoritarian leaders, even outside of the former Soviet Union. He provided critical aid to Syria’s Bashar al-Assad during Arab Spring protests and backed Venezuela’s Nicolas Maduro. In 2020, when Belarus’s Lukashenko was facing mass protests calling for his resignation, Putin offered a public show of unity and said Russia would send in military reinforcements “if necessary.”Lukashenko claimed, without evidence, that the opposition movement was a Western plot to oust him. Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev has similarly likened his country’s protesters to “terrorists,” some of which he alleged without offering proof are from abroad.Top security official is detained as protest-roiled Kazakhstan settles into edgy calmThese are favorite scapegoats of Putin’s, too.Story continues below advertisementDuring his news conference last month, Putin said that “opponents have been saying throughout the centuries that Russia cannot be defeated, but can only be destroyed from within,” which they accomplished “in the 1990s, when the Soviet Union was being dismantled from within.”“Who was doing it?” Putin asked. “Someone serving the interests of others that run counter to the interests of the Russian and other peoples of the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union, and the Russian Federation today.”Arkady Dubnov, a Central Asia expert, says the former Soviet Union is undergoing “a midlife crisis.” With the passage of time, those former member countries have fostered stronger national identities with wide-ranging aims, some of which clash with Russia’s identity and aims.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“That signals an end of a certain stage in the development of the post-Soviet space,” Dubnov said.“The people in power are people of the last century, both physically — I mean, they have been in power since the last century — and mentally,” he added. “Young people poorly understand them, and they generally do not perceive them as their presidents, as someone they elected or someone that share their values, concerns and problems.”Mary Ilyushina contributed to this report.Read more:Kazakhstan president gives shoot-to-kill order against protesters, dismissing calls for negotiationsIn their shared sea, Ukraine and Russia already risk direct conflict every dayAnalysis: What Putin wants in Ukraine",0,WashingtonPost

Massimov, who headed the presidential administration under Nazarbayev and is seen as a staunch Nazarbayev ally, was arrested along with several other officials, according to a government statement.State television aired accusations that the NSC’s former leaders conspired to train “bandits” who were behind the recent chaos. The protests prompted President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev to invite a Russian-led military alliance to intervene in Kazakhstan, while also ordering his troops to “shoot to kill without warning” in an effort to crush the demonstrations.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAfter days of speculation about his whereabouts, Nazarbayev’s spokesman said Saturday that the autocrat was still in Kazakhstan and wanted citizens to unite around his handpicked successor.

Almaty Airport, Kazakhstan’s busiest and now under the control of Russian and Kazakh forces, was still closed to civilian aircraft Saturday, while checkpoints set up during the nationwide state of emergency hindered domestic travel via rail and road.

Tokayev and CSTO allies, such as Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko, have sought to portray protesters as foreign-funded “terrorists,” though there is no substantive evidence to back the claim.The beleaguered Kazakh leader wrote on Twitter on Friday — in posts that were apparently later deleted — that about 20,000 people were involved in the upheaval and that they were responsible for “at least six waves of attacks of terrorists” in Almaty.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementHis claims bemused many Central Asian experts. “There are a lot of things that don’t add up right now,” said Jennifer Brick Murtazashvili, a specialist on the politics of the former Soviet Union at the University of Pittsburgh. “No one has ever heard of these terrorists in Kazakhstan before, and now there are 20,000 of them in a well-coordinated attack? It just sounds implausible.”Here’s what you need to know about Kazakhstan’s unrest and Russian interventionThe future of resource-rich Kazakhstan was also being discussed in Washington, Moscow and Beijing. China has invested billions in its neighbor’s energy sector over the past decade, and Chinese President Xi Jinping called his Kazakh counterpart to say that Beijing firmly supports the country’s stability and rejects any attempts by “external forces” to provoke unrest or “color revolutions” in the country.The turmoil within Kazakhstan could present an opportunity for China and Russia, Murtazashvili said. “We do see this sort of division of labor emerging in the region where Russia … handles the security and China handles infrastructure.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementWith its abundant and inexpensive energy resources, Kazakhstan has emerged as a hub for cryptocurrency mining, particularly after Beijing cracked down on the sector last year. The upheaval has affected the price of bitcoin, which traded at about $41,866 early Saturday, down about 9 percent from Jan. 1.The United States and Kazakhstan also have a long history of cooperation in fields such as energy and security. Washington was the first to recognize Kazakhstan’s independence from the Soviet Union, and Muslim-majority Kazakhstan supported the U.S.-helmed interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan.Another unknown is the fate of Kazakh sovereignty now that Russian troops are in the country, which President Vladimir Putin sees as part of Moscow’s traditional sphere of influence. Over the past year, Putin has tightened ties with Belarus, which he hopes to see in federation with Russia, while militarily threatening Ukraine, which the Kremlin does not treat as a truly sovereign state. In a call with Putin on Saturday, Tokayev said Kazakhstan’s fight against “terrorists” would continue, Reuters reported. The Kazakh leader also voiced “appreciation” for Russia’s assistance and for the deployment of CSTO forces, the Kremlin said in a statement.Kazakh opposition figure Mukhtar Ablyazov, a former energy minister now in exile in France, said in an interview with Reuters that his country was now occupied by Russia.

Could not be scraped,"The legal fight in Australia this week over star tennis player Novak Djokovic’s coronavirus vaccination status has shed light on stubbornly high vaccine hesitancy rates in his native country of Serbia.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightThere, only about 45 percent of the population has been fully inoculated and just 25 percent have received a booster shot, despite an initially successful rollout and a surfeit of doses.Djokovic has made several skeptical remarks about vaccines — and science in general — since the start of the pandemic but did not disclose his vaccination status. The 34-year-old, 20-time Grand Slam winner arrived in Melbourne on Tuesday after apparently being granted an exemption for the Australian Open’s vaccine mandate.Story continues below advertisementBut border officials quickly detained him at the airport and revoked his visa, saying that he did not meet Australia’s strict pandemic entry requirements. He is being held at an immigrant detention center until a court hears his case on Monday.AdvertisementAt home in Serbia, supporters have rallied to Djokovic’s side, hailing him as a national hero and accusing Australia of holding him captive.At the same time, new daily coronavirus cases are again on the rise after a devastating surge in infections from the delta variant across Serbia in the fall. This time, health experts say, the highly contagious omicron variant is to blame, with case numbers rising more than 152 percent over the past seven days, according to the World Health Organization. Story continues below advertisementSerbia, a nation of 7 million, has officially reported some 1.3 million total coronavirus cases and more than 12,800 deaths.But the country’s vaccination campaign — once lauded as the fastest in Europe — has stalled. It has been undermined in part by the rampant spread of conspiracy theories and misinformation, as well as a historic distrust of government institutions and Western medicine in general.Advertisement“In the case of Serbia, there is a general distrust of the state and political parties and institutions,” Jasna Milosevic Djordjevic, a Belgrade-based social psychology professor, told Radio Free Europe in October.According to Djordjevic’s research on anti-vaccine sentiment in Serbia, people’s distrust of political parties and the government also extended to the country’s public health system.Story continues below advertisementLong-standing corruption in academia and at hospitals helped foster skepticism. In October, the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network reported that the number of certificates listing the coronavirus as the cause of death in 2020 was actually three times higher than the number officially reported to the public at the time.“In Serbia, the government’s response has been erratic,” investigative health journalist, Hristio Boytchev, wrote in a British medical journal. “Authorities resorted to draconian measures at the start of the pandemic … Then, in May 2020, martial law and curfews were suddenly abandoned.”AdvertisementThe country’s populist president, Aleksandar Vucic, played all sides as the pandemic dragged on. He used coronavirus restrictions as a political tool and tinkered with the official death toll. He also relied on covid-skeptic advisers but secured a surplus of vaccines for use both at home and as part of his ambitions for vaccine diplomacy abroad.Story continues below advertisementIn a statement following Djokovic’s detention, Vucic called his treatment in Australia “harassment.”“I told our Novak that the whole of Serbia is with him and that our bodies are doing everything to see that the harassment of the world’s best tennis player is brought to an end immediately,” the president said.Read more:‘Novak Djokovic is not a criminal’: Serbia and Australia trade volleys as tennis star remains held in hotelThe self-belief that made Novak Djokovic a champion has put him in limbo in AustraliaAs Europe’s vaccination efforts falter, Russia and China are now seen as options",0,WashingtonPost

She estimated about 30 others from the Dec. 30 flight have also tested positive. Before the Jan. 5 return flight was canceled, St-Pierre told the wire service, some of the Canadian passengers put Vaseline up their noses, attempting to throw off the coronavirus tests.At a Wednesday news conference, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the passengers’ behavior “irresponsible” and a “slap in the face,” especially as, he said, many Canadians have made sacrifices to limit the coronavirus’s spread as cases surge.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementIn the past seven days, Canada has reported more than 240,000  new covid cases — a 36 percent increase, according to The Washington Post’s tracker.

In a statement to CNN, the airline said it canceled the flight “based on the group’s refusal to accept all terms and our security team’s assessment that non-compliance would be likely based on their previous disruptive onboard behavior.”On Friday, Canadian Health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos said that 27 of the passengers have arrived back in Canada. He said that they took four different flights and were interrogated and tested upon arrival.“AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementTheir behavior was irresponsible and inexcusable and unacceptable,” Duclos told reporters at a news conference in Ottawa.

They issued the most specific list of demands to date, asking for a change in power, freedom for civil rights activists and a return to a 1993 version of the constitution, which is considered to have a more democratic tone and a clearer division of power than the current one.Tokayev also promised to “turn the Internet back on” after a nationwide blackout, but he warned it would be accessible only for certain periods and highly monitored by the government. “Free access to the Internet does not mean you can freely post your musings, slander and insults, your incitements and calls,” he said.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementInternet services have been severely disrupted since Wednesday, global Internet monitor NetBlocks said, with connectivity at about 5 percent of normal levels as of Friday morning.Earlier Friday, Tokayev said in a statement that security forces have “mostly” regained control of the country. “The constitutional order has been basically restored in all regions,” he said.A timeline of how the crisis in Kazakhstan unfoldedIn recent days, protesters stormed government buildings nationwide and briefly held the Almaty airport.

Kazakhstan and the bloc’s other members, however, have attempted to cast the intervention as a bid to protect the state against “foreign-trained terrorist gangs,” although they have provided no evidence to back the allegations.Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday that the United States remained “very concerned about the ongoing state of emergency” in Kazakhstan and urged authorities to respond “appropriately, proportionately and in a way that upholds the rights of protesters.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe European Union’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, tweeted that the “rights and security of civilians must be guaranteed,” adding: “External military assistance brings back memories of situations to be avoided.”China, however, has come out firmly in support of Tokayev, the Kazakhstan president, with leader Xi Jinping calling him to say that China firmly supports the country’s stability and rejects any attempts by “external forces” to provoke unrest or “color revolutions” in the country.

It was too cold for his boys to go out and scavenge, so he reached for the log and started shaving off pieces.“The authorities tell us it is safe to return home now, but we have nothing left there,” Ewaz said with a sigh on Tuesday. Life in the city, though, has become much harder since the Taliban took power again in August. He earns less than a dollar a day, sewing soles onto shoes, and the cost of heating fuel has risen far beyond the family’s means. “At least this log will give us a few more hours tonight,” he said.The country’s new rulers, cut off from most international aid as well as Afghan government assets held in U.S. accounts, have scant resources to protect millions of vulnerable people against another harsh winter. Aid groups estimate that nearly 23 million Afghans, out of a total population of 39 million, already do not have enough to eat. Many also lack solid shelter and money to heat their homes at night, forcing them to choose between food and fuel, and creating additional potential for a full-fledged humanitarian disaster, aid officials said.More than half of Afghanistan’s population faces ‘acute’ food crisis this winter, U.N. findsMany Afghans were living a meager existence before the Taliban’s takeover.

Its major focus is on families displaced from rural areas by conflict, a group that swelled from 3.5 million to more than 4 million last year as Taliban fighters swept across the country. With the war at an end, UNHCR officials said, it is safer to deliver aid, but many of the neediest do not meet their strict criteria.As Afghanistan’s economy collapses, international community looks for innovative ways to avoid humanitarian disasterAfghan officials said Saturday that heavy snowfall had been reported in 30 of the country’s 34 provinces this week and that major roads had been blocked in 10 provinces.

Could not be scraped,"Sidney Poitier, who was the first Black man to win an Academy Award for best actor and who forever changed the perception of African Americans in movies with his powerful and charismatic screen presence, died Jan. 6 at 94.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightThe personal assistant to Frederick A. Mitchell, the minister of foreign affairs in the Bahamas, where Mr. Poitier was raised, confirmed the death. Pamela Poitier said her father died at his home in California, but she did not provide further details.As a suave and dignified star, Mr. Poitier challenged audiences to accept Black performers in leading roles in movies and on television. He upended a demeaning Hollywood tradition of casting Black performers in vulgar caricature or limiting them to singing and dancing roles that could be segregated from the rest of the film and cut out when the movies ran in the South.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementCornel West, an author, social critic and civil rights activist, called Mr. Poitier “the towering American artist of African descent in the history of film” and likened him to the first Black major league baseball player, Jackie Robinson.Mr. Poitier’s Oscar was for ­“Lilies of the Field,” a film released in 1963 — the same year as the March on Washington for civil rights. By contrast, the film, about a drifter handyman who helps nuns from Central Europe build a chapel in Arizona, made almost no mention of race, which Mr. Poitier, who championed colorblind casting, deemed as much a triumph as his Oscar.Sidney Poitier changed the Oscars in 1964. The academy is still grappling with the promise of that moment.At a time when much of the country remained segregated, he struggled to find roles as professional and authority figures, saying that his primary intent was to portray Black men of “refinement, education and accomplishment.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementPerhaps his most enduring and defining part was Virgil Tibbs, an experienced Philadelphia homicide detective who helps a bigoted White Mississippi police chief in a murder investigation in “In the Heat of the Night” (1967). The film marked the first appearance of a Black law enforcement hero in a mainstream Hollywood movie.The chief, played by Rod Steiger, makes fun of the name Virgil and asks Tibbs what he is called in Philadelphia. Mr. Poitier shoots back with a mixture of pride and barely contained rage, “They call me Mister Tibbs.”In the movie’s most startling sequence, the prominent owner of a cotton plantation slaps Tibbs for not knowing his place, and Tibbs slaps him back reflexively. Mr. Poitier wrote in his memoir “The Measure of a Man” (2000) that it was his idea for Tibbs to return the slap.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“In the original script, I looked at him with great disdain and, wrapped in my strong ideals, walked out,” he wrote. “That could have happened with another actor playing the part, but it couldn’t happen with me.” He insisted on a change to the script because of a searing experience as a teenager in Florida, when police stopped him for walking in a White neighborhood. “They really had their fun with me,” he recalled in the book. “They put a pistol right to my forehead. . . . And for 10 minutes, they just joked about whether to shoot me in the right eye or left eye.”As much as “In the Heat of the Night” secured his star luster, it was only one in a line of cinematic breakthroughs. In some of Mr. Poitier’s finest film performances, he was a medical resident harassed by a racist patient (Richard Widmark) in “No Way Out” (1950); an escaped prisoner chained to a bigoted convict (Tony Curtis) in “The Defiant Ones” (1958); and an ambitious chauffeur in “A Raisin in the Sun” (1961), a part he also played in the 1959 Broadway play and for which he received a Tony Award nomination.Mr. Poitier’s place in the 1960s Hollywood hierarchy — a major star with critical and popular appeal — was exceptional in the ranks of Black actors. Harry Belafonte, a popular singer of calypso and other folk songs, exuded more sexual charisma than Mr. Poitier but lacked his range. Belafonte tried to make it as a leading man in the 1950s before returning to a career in music and civil rights.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAfter his Academy Award win, Mr. Poitier said he doubted that the honor would be a “magic wand that will wipe away the restrictions on job opportunities for Negro actors.” Even at his career’s peak, in the 1960s, he said his creative control was often limited to rejecting roles that he felt were unworthy.He sought parts in which his skin color was incidental, including the Cold War thriller “The Bedford Incident” and the suicide-helpline drama “The Slender Thread” (both 1965), explaining that he hoped a race-neutral approach to casting would change perceptions in the film industry.But the thoughtful, unthreatening image he projected — playing a doctor engaged to a White woman in “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner” and a London teacher who tames rowdy students in “To Sir, With Love” (both 1967) — was out of step with increasingly assertive Black activism. In some quarters, Mr. Poitier came under withering attack.Writer Larry Neal was among the Black activists and artists to scold Mr. Poitier, calling him in 1971 “a million-dollar shoeshine boy.” Melvin Van Peebles, who made the politically radical film “Sweet Sweetback’s Baadasssss Song” (1971), wrote decades later in Ebony magazine, “Sidney was a wonderful actor, and we were proud, but nobody could really relate because the characters he was given to play were surreal, more from heaven than the ’hood.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementMr. Poitier was hurt by such criticism, but he understood it. He wrote in his first memoir, “This Life” (1980), that few starring roles presented “positive images” of Blacks and that “however inadequate my step appeared, it was important that we make it.”Film critic and scholar Richard Schickel said many in the Black community, as well as some White movie critics, wanted Mr. Poitier “to lead the revolution in the movies. But in truth, the movies were somewhat behind the ‘revolutionary curve.’ So what was on offer for Mr. Poitier was being a middle-class guy who, to a degree, challenged White smugness.”Directing became a way for Mr. Poitier to assert control over his image and, starting in the 1970s, he made comedies starring Bill Cosby (“Uptown Saturday Night,” “Ghost Dad”), Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder (“Stir Crazy”), and Wilder and Gilda Radner (“Hanky Panky”).On Aug. 12, 2009, President Barack Obama awarded legendary actor Sidney Poitier the Presidential Medal of Freedom. (C-SPAN)After being off the movie big screen for 10 years, Mr. Poitier returned in a pair of action thrillers in 1988, playing FBI agents in “Shoot to Kill” and “Little Nikita.” Four years later, Mr. Poitier was lured back to portray a cashiered CIA agent in “Sneakers” (1992), with Robert Redford and Dan Aykroyd, because “it was a wonderful, breezy opportunity to play nothing heavy. It was simple, and I didn’t have to carry the weight. I haven’t done that in a while, and it was refreshing.”Desperate povertySidney Poitier was born on Feb. 20, 1927, in Miami, where his parents were on a visit to sell tomatoes they had grown on their farm in the Bahamas. The family soon returned home, to the desperate poverty of Cat Island. His mother dressed the seven Poitier children in flour sacks.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAt 15, after being jailed overnight for stealing corn, he was sent to live with an older brother in Miami who could provide a roof but little else. After the frightening encounter with police in Florida, he left for Harlem, hoping to find a more welcoming environment for Black people.At first, he scrounged for change to sleep in pay toilets. When it became too cold to sleep on benches, he lied about his age (he was 16) and joined the Army in 1943.He became a physiotherapist at an Army psychiatric institution on Long Island, but his anger at what he called the “abusive” attitude toward the patients and the racism he encountered at a local roadhouse antagonized him. Through the intervention of a sympathetic doctor, he received an honorable discharge.Sidney Poitier acted his way out of a brutal introduction to AmericaFlipping through help-wanted ads in 1945, he saw a call for actors at the American Negro Theatre in New York. He figured it was easy work — that any profession that advertised next to requests for porters, busboys and dishwashers must require no special talent.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAt his audition, Mr. Poitier’s unintelligible, singsong island accent dismayed theater founder Frederick O’Neal. But O’Neal was in such dire need of male actors that Mr. Poitier was hired with the understanding that he would also moonlight as the theater’s janitor. (To polish his speaking, he bought a radio and studied the diction and intonation of the announcers.)During his first Broadway appearance, a small part in a 1946 production of Aristophanes’ ancient Greek comedy “Lysistrata,” Mr. Poitier suffered stage fright and began delivering lines out of order. But citing his “terrible fierce pride,” he later said he was determined to refine his skills. Over the next several years, his good looks and sensitivity as a performer brought him to the attention of Hollywood, and he made a strong impact in “No Way Out,” his film debut.In his second feature film, Mr. Poitier was cast as a young clergyman in “Cry, the Beloved Country” (1951), based on Alan Paton’s novel about apartheid. Working on location in South Africa, Mr. Poitier was forced to live far from the studio, and he had to deal with other restrictions and insults. Officially, he was an “indentured laborer” of director Zoltan Korda. Mr. Poitier later called South Africa “on a racial, political and social level, the worst place I have ever been.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementStill a relative unknown on-screen, Mr. Poitier owned and operated a Harlem ribs restaurant to support his growing family between movie assignments. He had married Juanita Hardy, a model, in 1950, and they had four children.“Blackboard Jungle” (1955), with Glenn Ford as a new teacher at an urban school and Mr. Poitier as a bright but rebellious student, was a major step forward for the young actor. The hit film, aided by a soundtrack featuring Bill Haley’s “Rock Around the Clock,” led to prominent roles opposite Rock Hudson (“Something of Value”) and John Cassavetes (“Edge of the City”), both in 1957. In the former, he was a conflicted Mau Mau sympathizer in Kenya, in the latter a dockworker whose interracial friendship with the character played by Cassavetes leads to trouble.Star billingsFilmmaker Stanley Kramer’s “The Defiant Ones,” in 1958, marked Mr. Poitier’s first star billing, which he credited to co-star Curtis’s insistence. Despite sterling reviews and leading-man Oscar nominations for Mr. Poitier and Curtis, they both lost to David Niven in “Separate Tables.”After that brush with glory, Mr. Poitier said he felt forced to take a leap backward in the 1959 film version of the George and Ira Gershwin-DuBose Heyward folk operetta “Porgy and Bess.” Porgy, he said, was an embarrassingly “outdated” part. But Samuel Goldwyn insisted on having him, and Mr. Poitier said it would have been a career-ending move to refuse such a powerful producer. (Mr. Poitier’s songs were dubbed by opera singer Robert McFerrin, the father of singer Bobby McFerrin.)To Mr. Poitier, there were consolations. During filming, Mr. Poitier began a long affair with co-star Diahann Carroll. It wrecked his marriage, he said, but Carroll “was confident, inviting, sensuous and she moved with the rhythm that absolutely tantalized me.”They reunited on-screen in “Paris Blues” (1961), about American jazz musicians in Paris. (Mr. Poitier later wrote that the tepidly received film would have been vastly improved if the two male stars, he and Paul Newman, had switched their love interests — Carroll and Joanne Woodward, respectively, as a commentary on interracial relationships.)Mr. Poitier made a notable return to Broadway in 1959 with Lorraine Hansberry’s drama “A Raisin in the Sun.” He played Walter Lee Younger, a Chicago chauffeur who wants to use his father’s inheritance to move his long-struggling family to the White suburbs.New York Times theater critic Brooks Atkinson singled out Mr. Poitier as “a remarkable actor with enormous power that is always under control.” Much of the cast, including Ruby Dee, reprised their roles for the well-received 1961 film version.Not long after, he read the script for “Lilies of the Field,” and he knew immediately that it was the type of part that most intrigued him: a showcase for his magnetism that did not have to make overt statements about skin color. It also seemed a decidedly uncommercial undertaking, utterly lacking in romance or action.The studio, United Artists, made “Lilies” on a minimal budget, and Mr. Poitier agreed to a cut of the profits instead of his usual star-wattage salary — in retrospect, a wise move because the film became an unexpected popular hit.The moment was primed for his Oscar — as a reward for his years of compelling work and as an industry response to the March on Washington. Veteran Hollywood columnist Sidney Skolsky wrote that “if ever there was a year when the Negro should be honored, it is this year, for obvious reasons.”Indeed, Mr. Poitier beat out strong competition: Albert Finney (“Tom Jones”), Paul Newman (“Hud”), Richard Harris (“This Sporting Life”) and Rex Harrison (“Cleopatra”).Mr. Poitier became the third Black recipient of an Oscar in an acting category. Previous winners were Hattie McDaniel, for her supporting role as the enslaved Mammy in “Gone With the Wind” (1939), and James Baskett, who received a special award for playing Uncle Remus in Walt Disney’s “Song of the South” (1946).Mr. Poitier remained a major box office draw for several years, starring at his career pinnacle in three of the top-grossing films of 1967: “In the Heat of the Night”; “To Sir, With Love”; and “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner.”The last — about an interracial couple whose nuptials are opposed by the parents on both sides — had the distinction of not ending tragically. But at one point, Mr. Poitier tells his screen father, “You think of yourself as a colored man. I think of myself as a man,” a line that typified what Mr. Poitier’s more militant critics found troubling about his roles.Mr. Poitier’s efforts to appear more revolutionary were critical and popular failures, including “The Lost Man” (1969), a race-conscious remake of the Irish-rebellion thriller “Odd Man Out.” In 1976, he married his White co-star in “The Lost Man,” Joanna Shimkus.He had four daughters from his first marriage and two daughters from his second marriage. A list of survivors was not immediately available.In 2002, Mr. Poitier received a lifetime achievement Oscar for “his extraordinary performances and unique presence on the screen and for representing the industry with dignity, style and intelligence.” That year, Denzel Washington became the second Black man to win the best-actor Oscar, for his role in the police drama “Training Day.”Mr. Poitier, who received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009 from President Barack Obama, disliked sweeping statements about his legacy.“I was part of an influence that could be called paving the way,” he told the Times of London in 1992. “But I was only a part of it. I was selected almost by history itself. Most of my career unfolded in the 1960s, which was one of the periods in American history with certain attitudes toward minorities that stayed in vogue.”“I didn’t understand the elements swirling around,” he continued. “I was a young actor with some talent, an enormous curiosity, a certain kind of appeal. You wrap all that together and you have a potent mix.”Read more Washington Post obituaries",0,WashingtonPost
Former President Trump Calls Kyle Rittenhouse a ‘Modern-Day Hero’ In Leaked Private Recordings,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – A leaked private recording was recently obtained exclusively by Empire News, wherein former President Donald Trump directly refers to recently acquitted teenage gunman Kyle Rittenhouse as a ‘Modern Day Hero.’“Mr. Ex-President is, naturally, very excited about this outcome,” says an anonymous source. “He loves Kyle, and has consistently been referring to the teen as a ‘modern day hero’ after what happened in Wisconsin.” Publicly, President Joe Biden has been very avoidant of commenting too heavily on his feelings about Kyle Rittenhouse’s arrest and subsequent trial. When Rittenhouse was acquitted last week, the Biden administration issued a statement simply acknowledging that “the jury system works, and we have to abide by it,” hinting heavily that he didn’t agree with the verdict. But Trump has been pushing in the exact opposite direction.“Oh man, Mr. Ex-President is jumping for joy over this outcome,” says an anonymous source who works for Trump. “He threw a huge party the night of the verdict. It was like a birthday party for a deranged toddler – there were pony rides and balloons and cupcakes featuring little automatic rifles drawn in frosting. He even set up a ‘pin the tail on the looter’ section, with giant pictures of African American rioters hung on the wall, and blindfolded guests trying to stick them with giant pins. Of course, Trump fell asleep about 45 minutes into the party, but we still had a blast regardless. Kid Rock played. It was kind of wild.”Another source claims that Trump and Rittenhouse have actually been texting each other since the verdict, bonding over their love for misplaced violence, a completely corrupt and failing justice system, and their mutual disregard for African Americans.

"Multiple People Hospitalized, Several Arrested During ‘Rush Limbaugh Has Cancer’ Celebration in Boston","BOSTON, MAOver a dozen people were hospitalized and 11 people were arrested after a massive celebration broke out in the streets of Boston on Friday.Last week, conservative dickbag Rush Limbaugh announced he had late-stage lung cancer, and liberals across the country let out a massive cheer. In Boston, a public celebration took place during the afternoon on Friday, with an estimated 35,000 people in attendance outside of Fenway Park.“When I heard that Rush was going to die, I couldn’t wait to celebrate,” said Rick Baker, 39, of Boston. “If there were ever a more worthless, piece of shit, talking head on radio and TV, I don’t know who it is. I heard about the party on the radio Friday morning, called out of work, and headed down to the park  to party.”Boston Police Department say that the gathering was not authorized, but they caught wind of the party on social media, and were able to send a “significant number of police officers” to the area to keep things under control.“We were able to keep things really under control under the conservative protestors showed up,” said Boston Police Chief Frank R. Green. “The people who were there to enjoy the celebration were great. Unfortunately, some Rush supporters spoiled the fun. In the end, we arrested multiple people and our police forces had to, sadly, beat down many protestors who did not listen to directions to vacate the area.”Green said that none of the “Rushers” had life-threatening injuries, and that most would be out of the  hospital within a few days.“Next time, perhaps these people will listen,” said Green. “If a group of people want to celebrate the inevitable death of a world class piece of shit, we will support that. If you want to get in the way of that, we will ensure that you’re dealt with accordingly.”Rush Limbaugh, who for some stupid reason received the Presidential Medal of Freedom last week, ensuring that it is now 100% meaningless, could not be reached for comment.",1,NewsEmpire

Just huge. I’m very excited to have people join me for this mega-rager.”Trump went on to say that several celebrity guests were scheduled to appear, including Eli Manning, Rush Limbaugh, Ted Nugent, and a “variety of Playboy Playmates” from the last several years.“Oh man, the amount of planning this has taken is immense,” said a White House staffer who preferred to stay anonymous. “When the President parties, it’s a big deal. We need to include a barrage of cocaine and alcohol to keep the guests happy, and I’ll tell you right now – if you think the impeachment was a waste of taxpayer money, the cost of this party is going to put that to shame.”Musical guests scheduled to perform include Kanye West, Dire Straits, and The Jesus and Mary Chain.",1,NewsEmpire
Parent Company of Corona Beer Sues China Over Bad Press During Their Coronavirus Scare,"MEXICO CITY, Mexico – Anheuser-Busch InBev, the parent company of Corona brands of beer, has announced they are filing suit against the Chinese government, after the massive Coronavirus scare in that country has caused a mass panic and multiple deaths. AB InBev claims that the bad press of deaths, mixed with the satiric natures of internet memes connecting “coronavirus” with Corona beers has caused them a loss of tens of millions of dollars.“Anheuser-Busch InBev feels that the Chinese government is solely responsible for putting the bad taste in people’s mouths regarding the name Corona,” said AB InBev spokesman Rick Barker. “The lack of their medical care, the lack of their preparation, has lead to a massive outbreak of the Coronavirus in China, and as such, has lead to a massive souring of our brand here in the United States.”The lawsuit, which claims nearly $200 million in damages, was filed in a superior court in Beijing, and names several specific government officials and medical personnel.“While Corona beer has never been particularly popular in the United States with anyone, outside of those who hate the taste of good beer so prefer swill that you have to add fruit to in order to drink it, but that’s not the point,” said Barker. “We are already feeling the pinch of this Coronavirus, and sales figures are dwindling daily. It’s only a matter of time before the connection becomes a total mixture of truth and reality, and people stop drinking Coronas all together because they think they’ll get sick from it. They will, but that’s because it’s garbage beer, not because it’s got any virus in it.”",1,NewsEmpire
Michelle Obama Files For Divorce After Shocking Revelation; Barack Obama Admits: ‘I’m Gay!’,"PHILADELPHIA, PAFormer President Barack Obama announced late last night that he had filed for divorce from his wife of 27 years, Michelle Obama, after he revealed a secret double life as a homosexual.“It is with a bit of sadness and a whole lot of relief that I announce that Michelle and I have decided to separate, as I have admitted to her, as I’m doing now to the rest of the world, that I am a homosexual,” said Barack Obama. “This may come as a shock to many, and anger others, but this is my personal business, and I would hope that everyone could respect my privacy at this time”Representatives for Michelle Obama said that she and the former president would split amicably, and that Michelle herself was “not particularly shocked” by the revelation.“We are very close, as close as two people could ever be, really,” said Michelle in a prepared statement. “I’ve known for many years about Barack’s secret life, and I fully support him in the direction that his life takes him. He was and is an incredible leader, a loving father and family man, and now he can go on to make some other guy, or multiple guys, very happy.”“Honestly, I was prepared to just stay with her,” said Barack. “I think she’s secretly know for years that I was gay, and since it already came out in every conservative news site years ago that Michelle was actually born a man, I figured that was close enough. I was prepared to stick it out and keep having young guys on the side. Michelle nixed it, though. She said if this was going to become public news, then there’s no reason we shouldn’t just split up and reveal our true selves. Whoops, I guess I just proved those rumors about her secret to be true, too.

President Trump Set To Legalize Marijuana on a Federal Level,"WASHINGTON, D.C. –President Trump announced earlier this morning via Twitter that he would be legalizing marijuana on a federal level, which would automatically lift restrictions in every state, even those that have yet to set up legalization and retail options.“At this point, there’s really no reason to continue classifying it as a Schedule 1 drug,” tweeted President Trump. “Everyone smokes it, or eats it in delicious little pastries and candies. Frankly, edibles are the only reason I can sleep at night myself. It’s been a long battle with wasted trillions of dollars, and I want it to stop.”The President went on to say that the influx of tax revenue at the state and federal levels would be astronomical.“Colorado can buy whatever they want, because it’s huge out there,” said Trump. “They can pay for education, healthcare, new roads, whatever. They can do that because of weed taxes. This is going to make the American people rich. Now we will be able to start building that wall!”",1,NewsEmpire
California Passes Law to Completely Ban Cigarette Sales,"SACRAMENTO, California – Lawmakers in California have passed a new law through the House that will completely abolish the sale of cigarettes throughout the state, according to reports.

Barack Obama Announces Plans To Get Elected As Italian Prime Minister,"FLORENCE, Italy – Former President Barack Obama has announced his bid to become Italy’s newest Prime Minister.

If the Italian people go to the polls and write me in, I can do for your country what I did for mine.”While there are several candidates currently running for the position, the Italian people are extremely divided on the ballots, and it’s likely that no leader will be chosen in the election. At that point, the existing sitting government can choose any person that the like, even if that person is not a citizen, and/or not a current member of government.“I’d like to also tell the sitting government that I will work just as hard for the Italians as I did for the Americans,” said Obama. “There is no doubt in my mind that my leadership abilities will outshine anyone else you have running currently.”",1,NewsEmpire
Rocketman And Dotard Agree To Settle Diplomatic Issues In EPIC Rap Battle,"WASHINGTON, DC – JUNE 26: Same-sex marriage supporters rejoice after the U.S Supreme Court hands down a ruling regarding same-sex marriage June 26, 2015 outside the Supreme Court in Washington, DC. The high court ruled that same-sex couples have the right to marry in all 50 states. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)North Korean leader Kim Jong Un had some choice words for US President Donald Trump Friday, accusing the American leader of “mentally deranged behavior.” He went on to say, “He is surely a rogue and a gangster fond of playing with fire, rather than a politician,” Mr. Kim said.Mr. Trump on Friday responded with some name-calling of his own. On Twitter, the president called Mr. Kim “obviously a madman.”Trump has repeatedly said that, “the time for talk is over,” and has proposed what is being called a radical diplomatic solution. Epic rap battle. As both leaders enjoy talking smack, and nuclear war would obliterate the human race, this is being hailed as the perfect solution.Initially Kim Jong Un proposed a wrestling match, but Trump backed down after hearing the rumor Kim Jong Un is a champion ssireum wrestler. Ssireum is a folk wrestling style and traditional national sport of Korea. While it is likely this is yet another one of Kim Jong Un’s unsubstantiated claims about his physical prowess, advisors warned Trump that at 71, nearly twice the age of North Korea’s leader, this was potentially a game he would not win.Although North Korea’s leader taunted Trump for backing down from the wrestling match, calling him a “frightened dog,” he accepted Trump’s suggestion to rap battle, saying he would “annihilate the senile, dotard, American snake bastard.”Critics worry Trump’s repertoire of racist slurs and “yo momma” jokes will not be enough to win the rap battle, but Trump is confident his old white guy swagger will prevail. “Rocketman ain’t got nothin’ on me,” he said in a recent tweet. Still, by coming up with an epic dis like Dotard, Kim Jong Un has demonstrated his masterful use of antiquated language and shown he knows his way around a thesaurus. Trump’s straightforward style may cost him points in the creativity category, as so far the best insults he has delivered include nicknames such as, Crooked Hillary, Lyin’ Ted, Crazy Bernie, and Low Energy-Jeb. “Cryin’ Chuck” and “Rocketman” do show he is capable of alliteration and ripping off Elton John songs though, so he may be able to pull it off.A date for the competition has yet to be set, but ample time will be given to allow each leader to prepare dope rhymes . The rap battle will be judged by a panel of hip hop artists including Ice Cube, Big Baby Ghandy, Kang Chun-hyok, and Yang Dong-geun. ",1,NewsEmpire
Lost City of Atlantis Uncovered In Mediterranean Sea,"BAZOS, Croatia – A team of explorers who have been searching for the lost city of Atlantis for the better part of 30 years have reportedly discovered the ruins of the Mecca, located approximately 30 miles beneath the surface of the Mediterranean Sea, directly off the coast of Croatia.According to the research team, there is more than $300 billion worth of lost treasures within the city, not to mention the city itself.“People have been searching for Atlantis for hundreds of years, with many thinking that it may never have existed at all,” said Mark Kempf, lead of the expedition. “Through hundreds of hours of research in books before setting out on our trip, we were able to locate the approximate area where we believed the city to be, and after repeated attempts to reach the area, we were finally successful last week.”Kempf says that it will become “increasingly difficult” to have many people visit the area, as he believes the more people that know the area, the fewer treasures there will be.“Oh, the place will definitely be overrun with pirates very quickly, which is why we are not releasing the city’s exact location at this time,” said Kempf. “This discovery will definitely put my children’s children’s children through college, though.”",1,NewsEmpire
Self-Professed ‘Fag Hater’ Wants Scientists To ‘Get Rid Of Rainbows’,"MOBILE, Alabama —With gay marriage now legal in all 50 states and rainbow flags (the universal symbol for gay pride) flying all over the country, one man who makes it a point to destroy every rainbow flag and spray paint over rainbow bumper stickers he sees, now wants to destroy actual rainbows.“I used to like seeing a rainbow in nature, ” Buddy Jones told Confederate News. “Now all I see is a symbol for faggotry. Makes me sick to my tummy to see a rainbow in the sky. I want to destroy them because they’re making me crazy and I think destroying rainbows will really get on queer’s nerves, but I don’t know how to kill rainbows myself.”That’s where Jones wants scientists to step in and help.“I know a lot of scientists are fag sympathizers,” Jones said. “But there are some good Christian scientists out there who could use their scientific smarts to destroy rainbows. Scientists can build talking robots and send people into deep space, how hard could it be to destroy rainbows?”Jones is calling out scientists to take up his rainbow destroying cause.“Maybe scientists could build a laser gun that instantly blows up rainbows,” Jones said. ‘I don’t know. I just think this is an important cause. Queers took rainbows from us and made them their own, now we gotta show them there are consequences to what they did. And think about this: How long before some other sicko group takes something cool from nature? Like clouds or something. We gotta destroy rainbows now.”",1,NewsEmpire
Could Denying Russians From Olympic Games Start Another War?,"RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil – Analysts fear tensions with the Russians could lead to another war if the Russians are banned from participating in the Olympic games. The Russian sports minister says “up to 67 athletes” have applied to track and field’s world governing body to be exempted from the ban on the Russian team at the Rio de Janeiro OlympicsThe IAAF is unlikely to approve most of the 67 athletes, since it has previously indicated the exemption is aimed at a small minority of athletes based abroad.When a global governing body for sports barred Russia’s track and field team from the 2016 Summer Olympics on Friday over a wide-ranging doping scandal, it was greeted in Russia, as is with a deep sense of victimhood.President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia called the decision “unjust, of course.”Mr. Putin said, “Russia is strengthening antidoping controls and athletes should bear personal responsibility for using performance-enhancing drugs.” Punishing the whole team, he said, “doesn’t fit any norms of civilized behavior.”Outside Russia, sporting officials viewed the unanimous decision as a long overdue restoration of some fairness in competitions. After all, in some sporting events Russian athletes had been trouncing competitors for years before it turned out they were using performance-enhancing drugs.",1,NewsEmpire
"Post-Terrorist Attack, Brussels Still Officially #SaferThanATrumpRally","BRUSSELS, Belgium – Social media has been abuzz the last few weeks with the hashtag #SaferThanATrumpRally, with many folks listing some absurd and dark places that are safer to be than at a Donald Trump rally.After the attack in Brussels, Belgium, most would assume that they’d rather be anywhere else, but according to social media, even the terrorist-attacked city would be a better place to be than with any view of Donald Trump.“I’d rather be in Brussels with a shirt with a target on it that says ‘fuck you, Muslim scum’ than ever set foot at a Trump rally,” said New York resident Joel Miller. “I was downtown during 9/11. Scariest time of my life. I’d rather live that all over again, too, than ever be at a Trump rally. The man, and his minions, are mindless, soulless villains.”As with all tragedies, everyone is standing with Brussels, and an onslaught of support has appeared from all corners of the globe, with many users on social media changing their pictures to a photo of the flag of Belgium in solidarity.“Donald Trump is a nightmare. I’ve seen people get punched in the face while simply standing still, peacefully, at one of his rallys,” said Maryanne Lewis of Detroit, Michigan. “I’d sooner throw beer and ham at a Muslim holding an AK-47 with TNT strapped to his ass than be at a Trump rally.

Weathermen Predict Heavy Snowfall In Summer After Mildest Winter On Record,"ATLANTIC CITY, New Jersey – Much of the country was unaffected by massive snowstorms this winter, with only one major storm hitting the Eastern part of the United States. Now, most meteorologists say that this summer will be the coldest in history, with much of the country seeing the snow they should have gotten in December and January coming in June and July.“I know it’s extremely odd to see these types of weather patterns, but it’s true,” said TV weatherman Joel Goldsmith of WMTX in New Jersey. “What people don’t understand is that global warming causes extreme heat, and extreme cold, and it cycles. Most of the country experienced the warmest weather in recorded history, and those temperatures will not hold up indefinitely.”Goldsmith says that he expects to see much of the United States getting hit with violent rain, wind, and yes, even snowstorms, throughout most of the summer months.“Most of New England will be buried this summer, upwards of 48 inches of snow can be coming in one storm over multiple days,” said Goldsmith. “Come July, you’re going to feel like it’s Christmas out there, because there will be record snowfall. Be cautioned, it’s going to get ugly. It’s not just New England, either. The entire country will be affected by this. Get your milk and bread tucked away now; it’s coming, and it’s coming fast.” ",1,NewsEmpire
China Announces Plans To Sell Tibet To Highest Bidder,"BEIJING, China – China says that they are willing to give up the sovereignty it has held Tibet since 1951 – as long as the price is right.Hippies and hipsters across the United States are already trying to raise awareness and encourage people to chip in to “Free Tibet.”“China’s actually really hurting. The US owes 1.3 trillion dollars it never intends to pay back,” said self-proclaimed ‘granola’ Cindy Morris. “The biggest thing is the bad reputation they have developed. ‘Made in China’ means crap. Plus, the pollution over there is really bad. Their government needs more money to process all the dead bodies.”Since the 1950s, millions has been donated to the Free Tibet cause, but it is unclear where this money is being kept or how much there is. The Dahli Lama has yet to release a statement on the matter, and the Tibetan Government in Exile has not been clear whether they will be able to afford China’s price. It is likely that they do not feel they are rightfully owned by China and will refuse to pay for their freedom.",1,NewsEmpire
President Obama Lifts Trade Embargo With Cuba,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – President Obama announced today that he would sign documents releasing the trade embargo on trades with Cuba, a blockade that has been in place for over 50 years. The move comes as part of Obama’s campaign to open more doors for American businesses to deal face-to-face with foreign companies.“I believe that America is the greatest nation in the world, and that we are also a forgiving nation,” said Obama. “We will never forget the Missile Crisis held over our heads by the Cubans, but we can forgive many nations of many mistakes. This is one time to forgive.”The embargo has long since blocked any American businesses from dealing with companies based in Cuba. The new ruling would allow goods to once again be bought and sold from the United States to Cuba, and vice-versa.“This is the biggest bunch of bullshit I’ve ever heard,” said Texas rancher Bubba Reynolds. “I paid over $2,000 for a box of high-end, beautiful Cuba cigars. I thought I was investing in my future. Up until yesterday these beauties were worth over 5 times what I paid. Now they’re junk, because any schmo can get them imported. Next time I deal in illegal trades with other countries, I’ll stick to Colombia and their cocaine.”The embargo dissolution will not take effect until the first of the new year.",1,NewsEmpire
"School Forced To Change Racist Mascot, Goes From ‘Warriors’ To ‘Wetbacks’","SKOWHEGAN, Maine – A small high school in Maine is fueling massive controversy after being forced to change their “racist” mascot name. The school, which has had the Warrior mascot for decades, decided to change the name after pressure from the community.“This area of Maine has a high concentration of Native Americans, and the warrior name was extremely offensive,” said Skowhegan resident Joanne Fisher. “I was one of the ones who voted for the change, because I have some Native blood in me somewhere, and I was utterly offended when I moved to the area 2 months ago. I think the new name is a lot better. I’m not Mexican, so what do I care?”The school chose to go with the new mascot, The Skowhegan Wetback, because they said that there are, in fact, no Wetbacks in the area.“This area has a decent population of Indians, Jews, and we have some Wops and a couple Gooks, but they keep to themselves and don’t get involved in social issues anyway,” said school superintendent Joe Goldsmith. “I for one was fine with the Warrior name. I think it had more to do with spirit than with the red-skinned people around here, but whatever. The new name works, too.”The school says that they will be abandoning the Warrior mascot at the end of the school year.",1,NewsEmpire
"Vivid Entertainment Offers Ben Carson $250,000 To Star In Adult Video Series","LOS ANGELES, California –Vivid Entertainment, the adult film company responsible for pioneering celebrity sex tapes and porn parodies, has reportedly offered current presidential candidate Ben Carson $250,000 to star in a series of pornographic films.Vivid, who have released tapes starring Pamela Anderson and Paris Hilton among many others, is looking to capitalize on Carson’s current celebrity status as a mumbling Republican presidential candidate, who was previously known best as a surgeon who separated siamese twins. Carson has surged in the polls lately despite his seemingly inept concept of politics, something that Vivid has says will actually be incorporated into the storyline of the films.Founder of Vivid, Steven Hirsch, says that if Carson agrees to star in the series, they will create three adult films that tell the story of his life. The first, to be titled Carson: The Teen Years would chronicle Carson’s sexual escapades as a mumbling teen prior to his career in medicine. The second film in the series, titled Carson: Mumble On My Dick would take place over the eight-year period of his medical school and immediately following. The final film, titled Carson: Sleeping The Election Away would feature Carson as he is today, boring and banal.“All the films will feature known adult film stars, including Vivid favorites Hanna Hilton and Kayden Kross, as well as some of our other Vivid Girls,” Said Hirsch in a pitch sent to representatives for Carson. “The story of Ben Carson’s life is big news, and we want to not only tell his story, but we want to tell it with some really great T&A.”Hirsch seemed to think that a venture into the adult industry could be exactly what Carson needs to “put a happier face” onto his campaign.“This whole thing, it looks bad to everyone, anyone who follows politics. As any country looking in at us, it makes us look horrible for even considering him,” Said Hirsch. “We want to help the Ben, and to pay some respect to a guy who’s been through a lot. So, we’ve already got the writer working on the scripts. He started this morning, so he should be done by lunchtime. These are movies we are dying to make, and Carson would be a fool not to get in bed with us. Literally.”Representatives for Ben Carson have said they are pushing for him to accept the offer, but so far he has not agreed to participate.",1,NewsEmpire
"France Bans Skinny Dog Models in All TV, Print Ads","PARIS, France – Following a ban on fashion models who are considered “too skinny”, France has continued to lead the way in body acceptance by announcing a ban on skinny dog food models. It is yet another attempt to convince dogs that skinny is not always better, and alert them of the dangers of being too thin. The SPCA have commended the French parliament, and asserted their belief that measures such as these will help to curb the spate of dog anorexia.“Far too often we have dogs sent to us malnourished,” said chairman of the French SPCA, Victor Houliston. “And so many more come to us with diseases related to food deprivation. It’s time to stop this from happening, and banning skinny models is a great start.”But dog modelling agencies, who face fines of up to $75 000 or 6 months jail time if they do not comply, have hit back, saying that this will further alienate skinny dogs, rather than helping them.“At the moment, people are biased against fat dogs, but soon it will be the skinny ones who are without homes,” said Albert Camus, founder of The Dog Agency. “You’ll walk through those corridors at the homes for neglected dogs, and see puppies with barely anything more than skin and bones, and no one will want to take them. It’s totally counterproductive and bound to fail.”Houliston responded that Camus’s rationale is manipulative, and that it “just doesn’t work that way.”“Camus is admitting that there is a problem – that this is just not the way to solve it. But that works against him, because his agency is taking advantage of that problem. That is all we are trying to change. Anorexia is spreading like wildfire, and we are already seeing skinny dogs being kicked out of their homes. Our policy is not what is causing that.”At press time, the French parliament had approved an amendment to the law, which will ensure that all skinny dogs out of employment will be compensated and supported until they can find new work.",1,NewsEmpire
Royal Baby Princess Charlotte Plotting Death Of Those First in Line for the Throne,"LONDON, England – The Royal Baby was finally born days after the original due date, and she is already plotting the death of those first in line for the throne. Prince William and Duchess Kate’s second child is fourth in line, behind her grandfather, father, and brother, and she reportedly will not leave her ascension to the crown to chance.“She’s a real darling, and has been born with all the classic aspects of royalty,” said royal analyst Priscilla Hendler. “She’s ready to lead a life devoid of all meaning and commitment to a monarchy with no power, and she’s ready to shed blood to lead that monarchy.”The princess is expected to kill all of her competitors by the time she reaches age twelve, when she will be of age to take the throne.Bookmakers have been scrambling to decide on odds of who will be killed first. Prince George, the little princess’s brother, is odds on at 2:1, being the closest in proximity and easiest to play off as an accident. Next up is Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, the princess’s father at 5:2. Charles, Prince of Wales, is next up at 33:4, since he is expected to forgo the crown in any event, and he’ll probably be senile by then anyway. Queen Elizabeth is at 2000:1 – she is expected to die within the next 12 years, even though she seems intent on living forever.The princess’s mother, Kate Middleton, is expected to be kept around because “as the queen mother she may be able to provide valuable insight from having lived the life of a commoner.”",1,NewsEmpire
Dalai Lama Considering Early Reincarnation; Just Wants to be a Kid Again,"TIBET – The 14th Dalai Lama has told followers that he is considering early reincarnation. His motivation, he says, is that he just wants to be a kid again. He looked back fondly on his early days before he was identified as the successor to the 13th Dalai Lama.“I was just over two when they came for me, and I know they say that you don’t remember anything before the age of three, but technically I’m way older,” he said. “It’s hard to be a Lama, especially one of the Dalai kind, and the idyllic days of lazing in the grass, with sand tickling my naked bottom – it’s hard to recapture them. When I do that now, I have to pretend it’s for spiritual reasons.”Mr Lama also spoke about his tense relations with China, due to his former alliance with the Tibetan Liberation Movement.“I want to be friends with them, not enemies. And it makes me sad that they stop me being friends with other autonomous nations.”The Dalai Lama has been refused entry into South Africa on numerous occasions, as they do not want to compromise relations with China.“I wanted to visit my old friend, [Archbishop] Desmond Tutu. But they wouldn’t let me go to his birthday bash. Has anyone ever stopped a toddler from attending birthday parties because of international relations concerns? No. Here’s to being a baby.”",1,NewsEmpire
Man at Party Actually Thinks His Story About Bad Restaurant Service is Interesting,"BUTTE, Idaho – Local man Ed Vermeulen, 37, actually thinks the story he is telling about the bad service he got at a restaurant today is interesting. The bore is, in his deluded opinion, regaling friends at the same dinner party with information on how rude the waitress at Don Pedro’s was, that he was given goats cheese in his chicken salad instead of regular feta, and that their prices were disproportional to their customer care.“He’s telling us about how he almost didn’t give a tip,” friend Roger Walter mumbled. “At least if he had carried through on that, there’d be something interesting about this anecdote.”Vermeulen is oblivious to the fact that his hosts are looking nervously at their watches, trying to lead their faltering party in a different direction. He doesn’t even realize that they’ve already interrupted three times, in an attempt to move on to the next course and a new topic of conversation.“For the amount of money they get paid – and yes, they get paid minimum wage which is more than they deserve – they really should put more effort into their work,” he is saying, drawing an attempt at an argument from one liberal friend, who is shushed by friends who will do anything not to let this story carry on any longer than it needs to. “I mean, Don Pedro’s is a respectable establishment, with a reputation to keep up.”Acquaintances are nodding their heads, in the hope that he’ll stop talking if they don’t actively participate, but Vermeulen is continuing, saying, “It’s not the only place that’s in my bad books,” bringing audible groans around the table.",1,NewsEmpire
American Airlines Annoyed That the Media Loves Plane Crashes,"CINCINATTI, Ohio – American Airlines has expressed its annoyance with the media’s obsession with plane crashes. The major corporation says that it can no longer tolerate the collective wankfest that takes place after every air disaster, regardless of nationality or even cause. Their patience was seemingly tried to breaking point by the recent response to the Germanwings plane crash, precipitated by a suicidal co-pilot. Approximately 150 passengers were killed, a detail the media repeated over and over again, presumably with its metaphoric dick in its hand.“The Malaysian flight that got lost… that was more than enough,” said Doug Parker, CEO of the transport giants. “With all their screwy theories, and the excitement over every bit of non-evidence… Then the flight that got shot down over the Ukraine, now this. It seems like all you see on CNN is plane crashes. It’s just not fair.”Media analyst, John Tremp, agreed with the sentiment.“The ratios are pretty insane,” said Tremp. “The number of planes that crash in a year – less than 200. The amount of airtime it gets on all media platforms – fucking enormous. It’s like the porn industry – there are exponentially more pornos portraying a housewife getting fucked by the pool boy than what happens in real life. It’s no wonder American Airlines is pissed.”But the media has collectively promised not to stop the immense over coverage of such events saying, “America perves over this stuff. Traffic on RedTube and YouPorn goes down – pardon the pun – during coverage of air disasters. We as the media are committed to giving the citizens of the USA what they want, even if it is somewhat sickening.”According to statistics, even articles blasting the obsession bring in unnecessary details of the event. For example, such articles will tell you that the co-pilot had been treated for suicidal thoughts, which surely is not something everyone has to know. Also routinely reported is inside info of the captain’s final words, including the devastating cry of “For God’s sake open the door!” – pure voyeurism.",1,NewsEmpire
Colorado Teens Injecting Marijuana To Get High,"BOULDER, Colorado – In a state where marijuana sales and use has only recently become legal, teens and young adults are already finding new ways of abusing the substance to get as high as quickly, and with as much strength, as possible. The new trend among teenage users is to actually inject marijuana in the same way someone would heroin or cocaine, shooting it directly into the bloodstream.“I’ve been smoking weed for so long, it just doesn’t do the trick anymore.” Said Lucas Davis, a 20 year old from Boulder. “I went on to dabs, and then to other more potent versions of weed, just trying to get as high as [expletive], ya know? Nothing has worked as well as just shooting that [expletive] right into my arm.”Doctors have already cautioned worried parents that if they aren’t quick to stop their kids from injecting marijuana, they may see an epidemic of young people addicted to the drug.“These kids who inject, they are far, far more likely to become addicted to marijuana than someone who just smokes it.” Said Dr. Michael Raymond, a surgeon at Bridgeton Memorial Hospital just outsider Boulder. “Weed is an immensely addictive drug. Patients of ours who smoke marijuana have reported that they became addicted almost immediately upon trying it for the first time, and most have to go through months of drug rehabilitation before they kick their addiction – and that is just the people who smoke it. Kids who are shooting up marijuana, they are headed down a serious drug path.”Despite warnings from doctors and other medical professionals, most teens say they aren’t worried about the repercussions of injecting marijuana.“I don’t get the fuss with weed, man. It’s all about chilling out, maybe eating a box of Zebra Cakes and watching Orange is the New Black on Netflix. It’s not like I have a real drug problem.” Said Derek Paul, a teenager from Aspen, Colorado. “Sure, I get paranoid when I’m high sometimes, but I stopped smoking and switched to banging [injecting] it because sometimes I’d cough so damn much when hitting the bong I thought my lungs were bleeding. This works better. It feels so [expletive] good to get high, you know? It feels really damn good.”Worried parents in  Colorado, as well as other parts of the country, have formed an online support group for people with children addicted to shooting up marijuana. The private Facebook group, Parents Against Marijuana Abuse, or PAMA, already has over 6,000 members.“You have all really given me so much support through these troubled times in my son’s life.” Said Erin Silver, who posted to the group’s page. “My boy Marcus overdosed while shooting up marijuana, and he almost died. When I showed him all the parents on here, people from all over the country who were scared for their children’s lives, he quit his weed abuse cold turkey. He’s been off marijuana now for 2 weeks. I am so proud of him.”“I’m not worried about what doctors say,” said Davis. “I just like the way it feels, and I’ll do whatever it takes to get the best high I can. Oh hey, have you seen my box of Bugles anywhere?”",1,NewsEmpire
"Netanyahu Secures Election Victory, Ready To Resume Guessing What U.S. Wants","JERUSALEM, Israel – Benjamin Netanyahu has been strongly criticised regarding statements he made immediately prior to the Israeli elections last week. He expressed definitively that the touted Two State Solution would not occur “on [his] watch”. Additionally, he warned right-wingers that Arabs were “coming out in droves” to vote, and that they must counter that; a statement that had not so subtle racist undertones.But Netanyahu characteristically responded powerfully this week, in an apparent return to the status quo of saying just enough to appease the US government and keep up relations between the two nations. He swiftly denied he had abandoned the Two State Solution, despite recorded evidence of him having done so. He also apologized for being racist, saying “some of my best subjects are Arabs”.Political analysts responded with an atypical disinterest to the Israeli Prime Minister’s remarks. According to them, the whole process was “tediously predictable”.“Everyone knew he’d pander to right-winger in order to win essential votes to keep him in power,” said NBC’s Hunter Worthington. “Of course, he could not stand by those comments without drastically damaging Israeli-US relations, which let’s be honest – Israel needs us more than we need them.”John Oliver, presenter of weekly HBO satire Last Week Tonight, was far more ebullient in his coverage of Netanyahu’s obvious political manoeuvring.“If he gets away with this, he should be known as NetanyaHou-dini,” the British anchor said. Oliver is known to pull no punches, even when it comes to important US officials and allies, and more is expected from him on this front.“I think we can expect John [Oliver] to mock Netanyahu’s future comments that he treasures his relationship with President Obama; his commitment to the safety of the Arab population in the Occupied Territories; as well as his assertions that he actually plans to work towards a peace that involves Palestinian statehood while opposing it in the UN.”",1,NewsEmpire
Abortion Clinic Busted For Selling Fetuses To Chinese Restaurant," SELLERSBURG, Indiana – A local Sellersburg establishment was shut down by police and health inspectors this week, after an investigation of the Beijing Chinese restaurant showed that they were purchasing aborted fetuses from the Sunbright Family Planning Clinic.Police first became aware of the Beijing restaurant using human fetuses as part of their cuisine when several people were hospitalized after eating at the restaurant. Representatives from the Sellersburg Department of Health were called by doctors at Clark Memorial Hospital to investigate the conditions at Beijing, assuming improper food storage or preparations. The Department of Health was shocked at what they found.“They had an entire walk-in refrigerator dedicated to unborn fetuses, all of them in different stages of dismemberment. It was clear they were using them as part of their recipes.” Said Brendan Kelly, department head for the Sellersburg D.O.H. “We immediately closed the restaurant, and contacted state officials.”“We were contacted by the Department of Health, who informed us that a local abortion clinic may be selling discarded fetuses to the Beijing restaurant.” Said Captain Joseph Goldsmith of the Indiana State Police. “We moved in quickly on both establishments, making sure that we got a lock on all this as soon as possible.”Along with the owners of the Beijing Restaurant, Soi Cha and Fo Shi, officials also arrested two men from the Sunbright Family Planning Clinic. Alex Coates and Ryan Wintson will be facing charges for their part in the theft and sale of the fetuses, which officials believe had been happening for years.“Alex and Ryan were two members of our nighttime cleaning crew who’d worked for us for almost 6 years.” Said Doctor Thomas Telford of the Sunbright Clinic. “I am shocked that they could or would do something like this. Sickened and appalled.”All four men will be facing charges in Sellersburg Superior Court. Cha and Shi, the purchasers of the unborn fetuses, are charged with assault and attempted manslaughter, because of the illnesses they caused in customers, as well as with the lesser charge of dismembering a corpse, which is a misdemeanor in the state of Indiana. Coates and Winston are being charged with theft and sale of human remains, theft of medical supplies and equipment, theft of medical waste, assault, and attempted manslaughter. Each are facing up to a 9 year sentence if convicted.“This is without a doubt the most disturbing thing that’s happened in this town.” Said Kelly. “We never expected to come across something so dark and grotesque.”Both Beijing and the Sunbright Clinic have been closed for investigation until further notice. Doctors at Sunbright Clinic say they were completely unaware that this was happening in their offices, and at the time of this writing, no charges were being filed against any of their medical staff.",1,NewsEmpire
Death Row Inmate Survives Execution; Released From Prison,"DICKSON, Tennessee – A Tennessee death row inmate has been released from prison today after two attempts to execute him have failed. Peter Farmington was convicted of 3 counts of murder in the first degree when he pled guilty to murdering his wife and their two young children in March of 2006.The prison warden, Joseph Goldsmith, called Farmington’s survival “a divine intervention.”“We have two methods of execution in the state of Tennessee.” said Goldsmith. “It is has always been our tradition to let the inmate choose how they want to go. Mr. Farmington is the first person to try their hand at both options. We are taking it as a sign from God that this man is just not meant to die.”Farmington had his first execution scheduled in late 2013 via lethal injection. At that time, his body did not react to the sodium thiopental, which is the first in a series of three drugs given to someone being executed. Sodium thiopental is designed to render a person unconscious before they inject bromide, which causes paralysis, and finally potassium chloride, which induces cardiac arrest.Dr. Robert Liston was the medical examiner on staff for the state prison during Farmington’s first execution.“I have never seen anything like it in all my years as a medical doctor.” Said Liston. “Sodium thiopental is not something someone can generally be ‘immune’ to, but Farmington’s body did not react. The drug should have hit him within 30 seconds. We waited over ten minutes, then dosed him again. Nothing.”Doctors and prison staff had no choice but to postpone the execution, and the governor granted temporary reprieve for Farmington, giving him another six months on death row, while he awaited his second execution date.Last week, the prison again tried to execute Farmington, this time via electric chair.“Farmington chose to not go through lethal injection a second time, and opted for electrocution.” Said Goldsmith. “We hadn’t fired up ol’ sparky since 2007, but it was his choice and we honored it.”Prison officials were stunned when, for a second time, Farmington was spared death, this time when the electric chair failed to operate.“We threw those switches, and on the third flip, you’re supposed to see sparks fly, but we saw nothing.” Said Goldsmith. “We got Farmington out of the chair, hooked everything back up, fired it up, and it worked like a charm. We didn’t even try putting him back in again.”Per federal law, Farmington was immediately released from prison, as any inmate who survives his execution twice is automatically allowed a full pardon.“We wish Farmington all the best in his new life outside prison walls.” Said Governor Bill Haslam as he signed Farmington’s release forms. “This man may be a bloodthirsty, violent individual, but some higher power has given him a second chance at life. We certainly hope he uses it for something better this time around.”Attorneys for Farmington could not be reached for comment.",1,NewsEmpire
Trump’s Secret Addiction EXPOSED! How The President Has Gone BANKRUPT Over Secret Purchases,"WASHINGTON, D.C. –President Trump has made a big deal about not showing his taxes, trying desperately to hide his actual income and net worth from the public. The reason why, many have speculated, is that he not only has cheated on his taxes, but that the forms would reveal how little he actually has in income. As it turns out, that is partially correct.Although Trump has made a fortune selling his name and branding buildings, it was also recently discovered that the world’s most powerful leader is completely and totally flat broke.“The President has a rather extreme, but somewhat relatable addiction to buying and collecting movies,” said a source from inside the White House. “I know that seems kind of bizarre, but Trump is like a big man-child, and his love of movies is vast. He has dedicated an entire wing of the White House to his DVD and Blu-ray collection. He has approximately 89,000 movies. It’s a full time job for a team of 3 people to organize and alphabetize his collection.”According to the source, Trump spends nearly $30 million a year on his movie collection, and lately that number has increased, as he spends more and more on high-priced, out of print collectible copies, and on newer and more expensive titles, such as those that are being released in 4K high definition. For someone who was reportedly worth billions only a decade ago, the collection has slowly killed his net worth.“The President has a problem, and it’s coming to a point where someone needs to have an intervention with him, but no one knows how,” said the source. “He’s out of control. On Black Friday, where sales are at their best, he went out and bought almost 100 new movies in one day. Then, just because that kick-started the buying bug, he ordered another 270 movies on Cyber Monday. The guy has a problem, and it’s killing us all.”",1,NewsEmpire
Man Arrested For Peeping Into Third Story Apartment Window To Watch Couple Have Sex,"BOSTON, Massachusetts – Police in Boston arrested Martin Landon Jr., 33, after he was caught peeking into the third story window of an apartment building, reportedly watching a couple have sex, while he masturbated.The authorities were called after the couple happened to look out their window and see Landon staring in at them.“My first thought was ‘Oh my God, someone is staring at us!” said Joanne Lavey. “I thought it was my husband at first, and I was finally caught in the act. But it wasn’t, obviously. My second thought was, ‘How the hell is someone peeking at us? We’re on the third floor! By now my lover had also seen him, so the party was over, of course. He went limp immediately.'”When police arrived, they found Landon with his pants around his ankles and his penis in his hand. They also happened to notice that the man had an overly long neck, and was only standing on a couple of discarded boxes in order to see in the third story window.“Mr. Landon would be of average hight, possibly less, but because of his 3 foot tall neck, it really adds some height,” said police chief Richard Jameson. “In this situation, it caused a couple some massive distress. Frankly, I can’t blame them. If I were in the middle of a torrid affair, looking on my window and seeing Landon would be the last thing I’d want to happen.” ",1,NewsEmpire
Man Born With Two Penises Is Suing The Government So He Can Marry Two Women,"WATERTOWN, Connecticut – Jerry Newbury, 29, is currently trying to sue the state of Connecticut, saying that polygamous marriage should be made legal, at least in special cases like his.“I was born with two penises, and therefore, I should  be allowed to marry two women,” said Newbury, a construction worker in Watertown. “I have never been sexually satisfied just having one woman, but this isn’t even just about the sex. This is also about love. I’ve met two beautiful, amazing women, and they both want to marry me. This is a quest for love!”A lawyer for Newbury, Martin Preston III, Esq., argues that “the time for polygamy” has come.“We have interracial marriage, we have gay marriage. I think it’s time that if a man wants to marry multiple women, he should be allowed,” state Preston. “This man is doing a brave service. Think of how hard it is having one, bitchy, nagging wife. Mr. Newbury wants to take on TWO! Imagine how painful this will be for him when their cycles inevitably match up? It will be torture.”So far, the judge on the case has not made any formal ruling.",1,NewsEmpire
Jewish Reporter Asks Trump If He Plans To Put Menorah In the White House; Trump Tells Him ‘F*** The Jews’,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – After lavish Christmas decorations and beautiful, “snow” covered trees were unveiled in the White House, many reporters and photographers were taken aback, and caught up in a Christmas spirit that many say was missing from the White House over the last several years.But one reporter, who happens to be Jewish, wasn’t as impressed. Silas Jones, 30, of the New York Beat Entertainment magazine was reporting on the White House Christmas unveiling, and asked President Trump if they planned to add a menorah to the White House decorations in a couple of weeks when Chanukah starts.“Fuck the Jews, no way am I putting up a menorah,” said Trump. “Everyone knows that the Jews are a dirty, disgusting people. And plus, they killed Jesus, and I can’t even stomach the idea of putting Jewey things next to these beautiful Christmas trees that my wife spent hours working to get up. No, there won’t be any Jew stuff here in the White House.”Although this is the kind of comment that would normally bring outrage from the Left and from civil liberties groups such as the ACLU, Trump’s comments like this come so often that no one was even that offended.“Totally expected,” said Jones. “I honestly only asked to get a rise, and he gave exactly what I wanted. He’s such an assclown.”",1,NewsEmpire
"New Poll Shows People Trust Flint, MI Tap Water More Than They Trust President Trump","DETROIT, Michigan – A new survey released today from the prestigious Harvard College of Detroit shows that residents across the state rated Flint tap water higher on the ‘Trustworthiness’ scale than current President Donald Trump. In the study, they found that Trump only was able to score a 14%, while Flint tap water scored a surprising 49%.“Well, what do you expect?” said Michigan resident Duke Henry. “Thanks to the tap water in Flint, we’re really, really good at smelling shit. We know when something isn’t right. I can’t see through the tap water here, but I can see right through that Cheeto, and all of his lies.”Resident Shirley Tanner agrees. “At some point you have to stop blaming the water for the fact your kids are dumb and lazy,” she said. “I would trust a fart after a Taco Bell run more than I’d ever trust President Trump.”Other findings from the study were also critical of Trump’s trustworthiness. “Donald Trump’s lies affect brain development, in both children and adults, but especially those active on the internet,” said Dr. Miles Teller, who conducted the study. “Exposure to Trump’s falsehoods can also cause, among other things, full-blown retardation in those exposed for long periods of time. The neurological and behavioral effects of his lies are believed to be irreversible.”",1,NewsEmpire
Couple Arrested After Police Discover Over 20 Thousands Pounds of Marijuana in Home,"CONCORD, New Hampshire –A New Hampshire couple has been arrested after an anonymous tip lead police to find nearly 20,000 pounds of marijuana in the home.Carl and Debbie Rutherberg, both 40, said that they had “no intention” of selling the weed, or transporting it, they say the simply buy a lot, and don’t use it very often.“It’s for our glaucoma, and for our aches and pains,” said Carl Rutherberg. “We don’t sell it, we never have. We’re good, honest people, and this is a huge mistake.”Ironically, the couple live in New Hampshire, sandwiched between other states, such as Massachusetts and Maine, where marijuana has been legalized – albeit not in this amount.“If we had a couple plants, and lived an hour south, this would have been totally legal,” said Debbie. “Instead, we get a few hundred tons and are stuck in New Hampshire, and we’re in jail? Live Free or Die my ass.”The couple face felony drug charges that would send them away for life.",1,NewsEmpire
President Trump Pardons Himself For Years of Sexual Assaults and Abuse,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – President Trump pardoned himself this morning for what he says are years of “alleged” sexual assault accusations, as well as rumblings of abuse. Despite the President not being formally charged with any crimes, many women have accused him of sexual misconduct over the years, all of which he has denied.“In the wake of my good friend, Mister Harvey Weinstein, being viciously attacked by the media over abuse charges, I felt it was time to act in advance of any legal or civil charges being lobbied my way,” said President Trump. “Although I adamantly deny that I have ever been sexually inappropriate with any woman, especially the ugly ones who always accuse me of doing so, I have fully pardoned myself of any and all crimes and charges.”While it was pointed out to the president that he could neither pardon himself, nor could he pre-pardon someone for crimes they have not been charged with, Trump remained steadfast in his decision that he had been fully pardoned.",1,NewsEmpire
New State Laws Will Base Your Speeding Ticket on the Model of Your Car,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – As of January 1, 2018, if you are caught speeding, the amount of your fine will depend on the model of your vehicle, lawmakers say. The change will be used to help pay for more police, and more road repairs in nearly every state in the country.“The more expensive the vehicle, the more expensive the fine will be,” said George Marks, R-Georgia, who sponsored the bill, which was passed by the House on September 21st. “If you can afford a $90,000 Tesla sports car, then your ticket is going to be a lot higher than the tool driving the beat up Mazda.”For photographs taken by radar, an auto expert will determine the model of the car, motorcycle, or truck. The cheapest vehicles will be fined lightly, whereas high-end vehicles will face much heavier fines.This measure acknowledges the inequality between those “who can afford” to pay the fines and those who “suffer” under the repressive system. Thus, the wallets of the most well-to-do will be hit just as hard as those of the most humble.The measure promises to reduce delinquency on the road by the wealthy, thus eliminating the feeling of impunity shared among more and more drivers.",1,NewsEmpire
President Trump Takes Away Citizenship of ‘Anchor Babies’ – Children Born In the U.S. To Illegal Immigrants,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Donald Trump doesn’t believe babies born in the United States to undocumented immigrant parents are American citizens.“I don’t think they have American citizenship and if you speak to some very, very good lawyers — and I know some will disagree, but many of them agree with me — and you’re going to find they do not have American citizenship,” Trump said Tuesday in an interview with Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly. “We have to start a process where we take back our country. Our country is going to hell.”Trump claims that those born on U.S. soil to illegal immigrants don’t have full citizens’ rights. “What happens is they’re in Mexico, they’re going to have a baby, they move over here for a couple of days, they have the baby,” he told O’Reilly. Trump asserted, “Many lawyers are saying that’s not the way it is in terms of this,” and went on to say, “They are saying it is not going to hold up in court. It will have to be tested but they say it will not hold up in court.”The GOP presidential hopeful does not, however, support amending the Constitution to repeal birthright citizenship, saying it would be a “long process.”“I think it would take too long,” he told Fox News. “I’d much rather find out whether or not anchor babies are citizens because a lot of people don’t think they are. We’re going to test it out.”Trump will begin the process to locate and deport illegal “Anchor Babies” as early as next week. Any immigrant who has illegally overstayed a visa or entered the country illegally, along with any children of illegal immigrants, no matter what age or how long they have resided in the United States, will be deported beginning as early as mid-February.",1,NewsEmpire

Now, of course, when she refers to his penis as the President’s ‘little Cheeto Puff,’ that might be crossing a line.

BREAKING: President Trump Gives Full Pardon to Bill Cosby,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – President Trump has reportedly offered comedian Bill Cosby a full pardon, after the fallen star was found guilty of sexual assault and sentenced to 3 to 10 years in prison. Cosby, who is a lifelong friend of President Trump, could have spent his final days in prison had Trump not stepped in.“Bill is absolutely and without a doubt, innocent on all charges,” said President Trump. “I understand very well how our court system works. I probably understand better than anyone, but that doesn’t matter. What matters is that I have met with Bill, we have spoken at length about the accusations against him, and I don’t believe a word of them.”Over 60 women came forward to say that Bill Cosby had assaulted them, with many being drugged and raped while unconscious.“We all know women like to gab, and this is a perfect example of why I plan to lower the crimes associated with assault or rape,” said Trump. “It’s obvious in this case that Bill had consensual sex with a woman who later regretted it, and then accused him of rape. Afterwards, of course, dozens of other women knew they could also try and make a dime off the publicity, and accused him as well. It’s sickening – truly sick – how some people think.”Cosby, 81, will be allowed to leave prison on Monday as soon as the pardon is signed.",1,NewsEmpire
"President Trump Vows To Lower Severity of Sexual Assault Crimes, Hopes To Make Them ‘Ticketable’ Offenses","WASHINGTON, D.C. – President Trump said this morning during a press conference that the “MeToo movement has gone too far,” and that “too many honest, hardworking men are being thrown under the bus with lies and malicious intent,” and that he plans to spend the rest of his time in office working to reduce the severity of rape and sexual assault charges.“In this world that we live, many men are having their lives ruined by false allegations and exaggerated claims, and it’s time to put a stop to it,” said President Trump. “I myself have been wrongly accused of sexual assault, as have many of my close friends, and it’s sickening. It’s terrifying to live as a man right now, and know that at any time, some woman who you may not even know could come forward and say that you forcibly kissed her, or groped her, or that you offered her money to sit on your face, and it could ruin your life. It’s disgusting behavior on the part of these women.”Trump went on to say that he felt that the transgressions of young men, if they happen at all, should be forgotten or pushed aside based on the work they’ve done and accomplished in the years since.“I will not comment publicly on whether or not I believe Brett Kavanaugh assaulted anyone, even though we all clearly know that he didn’t,” said President Trump. “What I do know is that the accusations are destroying him and his family, and that’s not right. It’s for MeToo to go away quietly.”President Trump said that he hopes to pass new laws that would decrease the criminal statute that would imprison people like Bill Cosby, who was sentenced to 3-10 years for sexual assault, and instead would allow men who are found guilty to pay a sort of fine, or restitution to the plaintiff.“It  is my hope that my son can grow up in a world where no woman will ever accuse him of touching her inappropriately, whether he did or not,” said Trump. “I want to keep Making America Great Again, and at this point, this is my number one concern.”",1,NewsEmpire

If the Italian people go to the polls and write me in, I can do for your country what I did for mine.”While there are several candidates currently running for the position, the Italian people are extremely divided on the ballots, and it’s likely that no leader will be chosen in the election. At that point, the existing sitting government can choose any person that the like, even if that person is not a citizen, and/or not a current member of government.“I’d like to also tell the sitting government that I will work just as hard for the Italians as I did for the Americans,” said Obama. “There is no doubt in my mind that my leadership abilities will outshine anyone else you have running currently.”",1,NewsEmpire
Teen Files Lawsuit Against His Parents Because He Was ‘Born Black’,"BOSTON, Massachusetts – A 16-year-old in Boston has filed one of the most controversial lawsuits in modern history, with legal reports showing that he is suing his own biological parents for being born black.Jamal Cutler, 16, claims he has suffered his whole life from the shame of being born black, especially because he goes to a predominantly white school outside of Boston, Massachusetts.\“When I was a kid, I’d spend hours in the shower trying to wash off all the black from my skin, but it would never go away,” he recalls painfully.His parents admit they were completely in shock when they learned their son had hired a lawyer against them. “We just want to end this nonsense, and we want him to come back home. We will love him no matter the color of his skin,” said Cutler’s mother, Maria, 48. “I’d love him even if he was the color of a baboon’s ass.”The young man’s lawyer, Robert Hoffman, claims his client has suffered severe psychological distress, symptoms of depression, and suicidal tendencies because of what he called “the burden of being a minority.”“My client did not choose to live this kind of life. Why would he have to carry the burden of hundreds of years of slavery and racism all because his parents had the selfish desire to bring a child into this world?” he sad during the suit’s opening statements before a judge and grand jury. “Because of the level of psychological distress of my client, we ask that his parents pay for all necessary expenses to change his racial status, including skin coloring treatments.”Cutler, who plans to change his name to John Smith after he converts to “white,” is asking that his parents pay for the $20,000 skin coloring treatment he needs.His lawyer argued in court that $20,000 is a low price to pay to positively change this young man’s life, considering the suicidal tendencies of his client and the “profound feeling of shame and despair” his client has faced since his birth.",1,NewsEmpire

Every time I think of sex I remember these purulent genitals, so I start panicking, sweating and even vomiting.” In 2012, he was diagnosed with a Sexual aversion disorder (SAD), a disorder characterized by disgust, fear, revulsion, or lack of desire in consensual relationships involving genital contact.This type of psychological disorder is usually caused by some traumatic event which causes sex to be associated with a painful experience.He had to undergo years of psychotherapy and is still heavily medicated, that’s why he demanding almost half a million dollars from his former school.Holmes’ lawyer says that he believes that the case is a “slam dunk.” Holmes claims that the first thing he plans to do after receiving his winnings is to pay a “lady of the night” to finally take his virginity, but he hopes that he can find a nice one so that afterwards he can settle down.",1,NewsEmpire
"White College Prof. Tries To Prove There’s No Racial Bias By Police, Undergoes Surgery To Look Black – He’s Instantly Shot and Arrested","BOSTON, Massachusetts – A white college professor at Boston College, Mark Ryder, 38, underwent over 200 hours of expensive cosmetic surgery to look “as black as possible,” with hopes that he could prove to his Ethics in Law class that there was no such thing as a racial bias by police, and that the media like to hype up issues with African Americans by police.According to reports, though, Ryder was shot and later arrested by police after he tried to leave his doctor’s office and walk to his own car across the street.“My client was simply walking to his car, which happened to be a brand new Tesla, and was stopped by police,” said Ryder’s lawyer, Carlton Fisher. “They assumed he was stealing it, and despite when being asked to show his hands and complying, officers shot Mr. Ryder twice. He was struck in the arm and the ribs.”Police reports show that Ryder was “not cooperative” with police requests, and was shot after an officer believed he was reaching for a weapon. Naturally, the officer’s body camera was switched off.Ryder has since been released from prison, and is planning a lawsuit against the Boston PD. He has also retired from teaching Ethics in Law, stating that “English is a much easier, more straight-forward class.”",1,NewsEmpire
New Husband Files For Divorce After Discovering His ‘Wife’ Is Actually a Man,"BOSTON, Massachusetts –A man has filed for divorce only hours into his own wedding night after panicking after discovering that his new wife was not exactly what “she” claimed to be.Ken Spencer, 26, filed for a divorce with Tiana Smith, 28, only four hours into their wedding night, after discovering his partner had a penis.The newlyweds, who are both devout Catholics, and had waited until marriage to partake in any sexual relationship, were about to consummate their vows, when Spencer discovered things were not “as they should be.”“It’s short, stumpy and crooked. It leans on the right at a 45-degree angle, then curves back to the left. It’s definitely the grossest thing I’ve ever seen,” he explained. “I thought that Tiana was a woman. She…he…whatever. There was no mention that he was a man.”Divorce attorney Kevin Goldstein claims that his client was lied to about the sex of his partner, who had never told him that he was born a man, and still had a penis.Spencer is also suing his former partner for $30,000, which is what he estimated was spent in wedding costs, plus a canceled $5,000 honeymoon trip to Hawaii. “Tiana had sent me pics of her boobs and even a couple down-the-pants shots, and I still have them on my phone,” said Spencer. “She was definitely trying to deceive me. It was either someone else’s vagina, or she tucked it back. Either way, I’m sick just thinking about it. I’ll show them to the  judge, and he’ll agree with me.”In many states, the fraudulent conduct of one spouse may provide grounds for divorce. The definition of fraud in the context of divorce law equates to one spouse “grossly misrepresenting issues so important that the other spouse would not have married him had she known the truth.”",1,NewsEmpire
Trump Begins Waging Battle Against The ‘War on New Year’s Eve’,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Now that President Trump has successfully won the War on Christmas, he is setting his sights on another age-old advisory: The War on New Year’s Eve.“It’s despicable that there are so many people wishing each other a ‘Happy New Year,’ when they have no idea if I believe that next year is going to be better than this one,” said President Trump. “Liberals like to push their agenda, they want you to have a happy 2018. Well that’s not right, that’s not going to work for everyone. 2017 was a big year. The biggest year. I’m not saying 2018 can’t be a big year, but we can’t just go out assuming it’s going to be great, it’s going to be happy.”Trump said that he has begun wishing people a “decent New Year” or an “Okay New Year,” and on at least one occasion, a “shitty New year.”“I have no reason to wish that specific person a Happy New Year, and I don’t particularly want them to have a Happy 2018,” said Trump, not mentioning the person by name. “Frankly, though, this entire happy nonsense has got to stop. I’m officially declaring it dead, and killing this war on New Year’s. ",1,NewsEmpire
Man In Alabama Uses Legal Loophole To Marry Baby,"DECATUR, Alabama – A Decatur man, 47-year-old Mark Perry, has found a legal loophole in Alabama law that will allow him to marry a 19-month-old baby. Perry, a lawyer for more than 20 years, said he discovered the loophole by accident almost a decade ago, but never thought that he, himself, would need it.“It wasn’t until I met Charlene that I knew, we had to be together,” said Perry. “She’s absolutely the one for me, and there’s no one I’d rather spend the rest of my life with.” The law in Alabama stipulates that a man must be of legal, consenting age to agree to marry, but the poor wording means that a woman could enter into marriage at any age. Because Charlene cannot sign her own name, though, her father will have to give consent and sign for her. Thankfully for Perry, Charlene is the daughter of his law partner, Craig Lewis. Lewis says that he is absolutely “overjoyed” at the thought of his long-time friend marrying his daughter.“Frankly, I wish that they would have found each other sooner,” said Lewis. “I’ve never seen Charlene so happy before in all of her life. Most of the time, she cries and whines, but not when she’s with Mark. He’s the only one who can calm her down. It’s really amazing, their love is so pure and true.”The couple are planning a spring wedding.",1,NewsEmpire
"Donald Trump Signs Bill Reversing Gay Marriage, Mainstream Media Completely Silent","WASHINGTON, D.C. – In an unplanned and quietly announced session at the White House on Friday, President Trump signed a bill reversing the gay marriage laws, and revoking the right for homosexuals to get married. The bill was signed only a short 20 minutes after Trump’s tax plan was made official.“As a Christian, and as someone who wants America to be great again – as great as possible – I cannot, in good conscience, allow for gays to get married in this country,” said President Trump. “They will have to settle for just being boyfriends or girlfriends. That’s really all they need, anyway.”The decision to reverse the law, which of course was created under Obama, comes as no surprise to Trump supporters, even the gay ones.“I voted for him so, I mean, I guess that’s what I’m going to get, you know?” Said Marcus Crumb, a gay man in New York City. “I don’t know why I even marked his name off on the sheet. I could have chosen Jill Stein, you know? But she just has like, no style at all, and Trump wears just the most fabulous suits. I’ll take looking at Trump over getting married any day. No one says I can’t still like pumping a guy in the ass, right? I don’t need a piece of paper just ’cause I’m in love.”",1,NewsEmpire
New Jeresey Teenager Hospitalized With Facebook Withdrawals,"CAMDEN, New Jersey – Nancy Thompson, 15, was hospitalized today for severe withdrawal symptoms caused by her parents taking away her computer, cell phone, and her Facebook privileges. Thompson, who was being punished for a poor grade in math, was taken to the emergency room at Camden-South Medical Center after her parents found her in bed with cold sweats, thumb twitches, and general zombie-like behavior.“I was terrified, we both were.” Said Marge Thompson, Nancy’s mother. “I heard noises and murmuring upstairs. I went to Nancy’s room, and she was rocking back-and-forth on her bead, mumbling “Like. Like. Comment. Like. Share,” and her thumbs were twitching in a texting motion involuntarily. We called 9-1-1 immediately.”Ambulances were at the Thompson house in minutes, with paramedics prepared for the worst.“We arrived, and Nancy was still trembling. It’s a scene I’ve bared witness to many times lately. The ‘Social-Media Shakes’, that’s what we call them.” Said Glen Lantz, one of the paramedics on the scene. “We were loading her into the ambulance, and that was when I saw the look she had. Nancy had a pretty standard resting bitch face, but then I saw her lips starting to curl back and one arm started to rise above her head. I recognized the selfie-signs instantly, and immediately sedated her before any of us had to see her morph into duck face mode.”Parents today are more and more often using social media restrictions as punishments for their children and teenagers. As evident in Nancy’s case, it is not always the best solution. Rod Lane, a professional child psychiatrist, says that teens and young adults need their social networks more than ever, and taking them away can have serious adverse effects, much the same as with drug and alcohol addiction.“I know that when your teen does something wrong, telling them they can’t get on Facebook is the quickest thing to come to your head. I implore all parents, please don’t do this.” Said Lane. “Your child needs to be weened off their social media, like a heroin abuser who goes to a methadone clinic. Just like with “true” drugs, your child can become violent and hostile, or conversely, they can become completely withdrawn and depressed, all because social media is removed from their lives too quickly.”Nancy’s father, Donald Thompson, says that the first thing he did when Nancy awoke in the hospital was give her back her 32GB gold iPhone 5 so she could get online.“I never want to have to go through something like this again. I swear I will never take away her Facebook privileges as long as I live. My baby girl can take all the half-nude, fake tanned, stupid-ass duck face pictures she wants. I’ll even ‘like’ them all myself!”Nancy responded by saying it would be a “cold day in hell” before she added her dad on Facebook. She also updated her status on Facebook to “Prnts are soooo f-ing lame. hospitul food sucks. some1 bring me an f-ing Pinkberry like NOW!” It immediately received ‘Likes’ from 143 of Nancy’s 2,486 friends. ",1,NewsEmpire
School Suspends Student For Gun Shaped Birthmark,"MILFORD, Connecticut – A 13 year-old middle school student was suspended today when a teacher noticed that the boy had a “gun shaped” birthmark on his leg. The boy, whose name was not released at his parents’ request, wore shorts to school for the first time this year, and when the teacher, Charlene Brooks, saw the birthmark on his leg she immediately informed the school principal and superintendent.“You cannot be too careful in this day and age. We don’t want to promote guns or gun violence in our schools. What if another kid in the class saw that? He might have gotten excited and wanted a gun birthmark, too.” Said Brooks, an English teacher at Milford Jr. High. “I don’t think it’s appropriate in our school.”Recently throughout the country there has been an excessive amount of “gun paranoia” in schools, with children being suspended or even expelled for things as menial as biting a Pop-Tart into the shape of a gun or even just pointing a finger at someone else and saying “boom,” which is what happened only a few short months ago in Ohion to 10 year-old Nathan Entingh.“I cannot believe that this is happening to my son.” Said the parent of the suspended student. “This is way too far. He can’t control this. This is completely and utterly absurd. It was 94 degrees here yesterday. Is he supposed to wear pants every day until the end of the school year? Or maybe they want me to chop his leg clean off?”According to school superintendent Donna Winter, that is exactly what the school expects.“When [name deleted] returns to school in 4 days, we will still have just about a week left of school. We are expecting that he will continue to wear long pants throughout the school year, and indeed, for the remainder of his schooling here in the Milford School District. Of course, he is always allowed to take the extreme decision of removing his leg entirely. It’s possible that would be best not only for his return to school, but also for his future. We’re talking about guns, here.”The parents have contacted a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union to argue that it is outside of the school’s rights to force only their son to wear long pants. “Either everyone has to wear pants, or my son doesn’t either. We can’t make everyone else have gun shaped birthmarks, so they can’t make him wear pants.”The family is debating on homeschooling their son for the remainder of his education to avoid any further conflict. It is unclear, at this time, whether or not there will be any police involvement with the student for his “carrying a concealed birthmark.”",1,NewsEmpire
Democrats Invite Iranian President To Speak Before Congress ‘Just To Piss Off Republicans’,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – In the latest round of exchanged animosities between the Republican and Democratic Parties, Barack Obama has officially invited Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, to speak before Congress. The news comes in the wake of House Speaker, John Boehner, inviting Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to speak in what is usually considered a ‘sacred’, constitutionally defended forum.“We think it’s only appropriate that President Rouhani gets the same opportunity as Netanyahu,” Obama told a press conference. “After all, Netanyahu’s speech was designed as a defamation of Rouhani’s country. Also, we happen to know that the Republicans will hate this. Two can play at this game.”Political experts around the country have been frantically throwing their opinions at our reporters.“Get ready for a fight night like never before!” said Rita Harlow. “I expect Boehner and Obama to get physical this time around.”“Rouhani is gonna blow those Republicans away,” Noel Reed told us. “Not literally – I mean, not with a nuclear bomb or anything. I mean, oh God, I didn’t mean… I don’t know anything I promise!”Congress has already been likened this week to a ‘high school’, a ‘neighborhood watch meeting’, and a ‘parents-teachers AGM’. The Republican invitation to Netanyahu – which was kept secret until all plans were finalised – was an unprecedented breach of protocol. All the more so, since Netanyahu’s agenda was apparent – as the speech coincided with the upcoming Israeli elections.“We’re organizing new elections in Iran,” said minority leader Nancy Pelosi. “Our move has to be just as petty as theirs. Otherwise, they still have one up on us. Which is entirely unacceptable when dealing with petty politics.”Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, for his part, has thanked the Democratic Party for inviting him to speak before Congress. Although his gracious acceptance did have one caveat.“I’m delighted to have the opportunity to speak to Congress,” he said. “However, I want to ensure that no partisan politics are reflected in the decision. Otherwise, no deal. I will not compromise the stature of Iranian Democracy for the petty infighting of US politics.”",1,NewsEmpire
Man Drives Car Through Donut Shop After Learning They Are Out of Maple Glazed,"MILFORD, New Hampshire – Johnathan Elm, 27, was arrested Tuesday morning after driving his car through the front window of a local donut shop. Elm was apparently upset that the store, Wicked Good Donuts, had just run out of his favorite donuts, maple glazed.“He started yelling and screaming and cursing at us, calling us ‘Donut-Hole Whores’ and ‘Pastry Pimps,’ seriously bizarre and crazy things,” said shop owner Marlene Simmons. “It was scary. We asked him to leave and he wouldn’t, but when I went to call the police, that’s when he ran out of the store.”Reports by people outside the shop say they heard Elm screaming, and saw him running out the door, where he bolted across the street and got into his car.“He was parked outside, across the road,” Said Joey Goldsmith, an eyewitness. “I watched him get into his car and then  immediately drive it straight at the front window of the donut store. The glass shattered and then there were donuts and crullers flying all over the place. Sugar and liquid glaze went everywhere. It was like a diabetic nightmare out here.”Elm was knocked unconscious during the accident when his airbag failed to deploy, causing him to crash directly into a rack of freshly made muffins.“Blueberry corn muffins, our top seller. On sale this week for 4 for $6.99. Best deal in town,” said Simmons.Not surprisingly, there were several police cruisers in the vicinity of the donut shop at the time of the accident, and Elm was immediately arrested and taken into custody, charged with reckless endangerment, attempted assault, and rampant destruction of delicious breakfast foods. He was initially brought to Milford Memorial Hospital to treat minor injuries sustained in the crash.Police say that Elm blames his actions on Michael Vale, the actor who played “Fred The Baker” in many early Dunkin Donuts commercials.“Fred knew when it was time to make the donuts. He was always making the f—— donuts. He’d have never run out of maple glazed! Never!” Said Elm in a police interview.Elm was held and released Friday on $15,000 bail, and is currently restricted from entering any establishment that sells donuts or donut paraphernalia. ",1,NewsEmpire
"Man Electrocuted, Dies While Smoking E-Cigarette","BOSTON, Massachusetts –  Michael Del, a 34 year old construction worker from Boston, Massachusetts, was killed early last Wednesday as the e-cigarette he was smoking sent a jolt of electricity through his body, knocking him unconscious. Del, who was on a lunch  break while working an overnight on job site in Cambridge, had reportedly been using the e-cigarettes to help quit smoking, a habit he had for nearly 20 years. He was rushed to Massachusetts General Hospital where doctors were unable to revive him. They pronounced him dead at 7:18AM.“Michael started smoking really young. It was my fault. I smoked around him all the time, and left cigarettes laying around,” Said Charmaine Del, Michael’s mother. “He had decided he wanted to quit. We both did, and we heard the e-cigs were a good way to help. So I bought us both one to get started. He’d only been using it for about a week.”Reports from the hospital were that Del had been using his e-cigarette while it was plugged into his truck, charging. E-cigarettets are small, pen-sized items that contain internal batteries, and smokers can add nicotine-infused flavor ‘cartridges’ into them. Just like a cell phone, the batteries can be charged, and most e-cigarettes come with USB charger similar to that of a phone.The instructions for most e-cigarettes that have chargers insist that you do not try to use them while charging, but like most men Del apparently skipped the directions and opted to just try and figure out how they worked using trial-and-error. Unfortunately for him, the warnings posted on the package for this product were extremely important.A representative for Black, INC., the manufacturer of the e-cigarette Del had purchased, released a statement expressing their condolences.“We at Black are extremely saddened to learn that one of our products has caused the death of a customer. We are terribly sorry, as these unfortunate events are never easy for anyone. We send or deepest sympathies to his family. As this is the first such death from e-cigarettes though, we’d like to remind people that we’re still doing far better than Big Tobacco, whose death toll is in the millions.”E-cigarettes have been a continued source of controversy since they first launched only a few short years ago, and the debate about their safety in comparison to a traditional cigarette has caused a stir in the medical community. This is the first death caused by e-cigarettes since their widespread use began in 2003.",1,NewsEmpire
Obama Signs Bill Forgiving All Student Loan Debt,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Americans who are under the financial strain of repaying student loan debt may now be off the hook for their education costs. President Obama signed a new federal bill this week releasing any student who has accrued outstanding debt because of the high interest rates and outrageous balances caused by college loans.“Any student, past or present, who has taken loans from the federal government within the last 10 years to pay for higher education, will no longer be required to pay back those loans.” Said President Obama. “This forgiveness also is to be extended to any student currently enrolled in college, who may need financial assistance for the next several years as they finish their degrees.”The idea of student loan forgiveness has been in the news for several years now, as students are forced year-after-year to leave school due to crippling costs of a higher education in the US. With most students not able to afford any facet of college without loans, the government has given out nearly $1 trillion dollars to those seeking a form of higher education. Although certain costs of school are generally offset by private loans, grants, and scholarships, almost every student currently in a 2 or 4-year program has some existing loans with the US government.“Education is the single most important thing in my mind when it comes to furthering this great nation.” Said Obama. “I can think of no better way to help the young people, this next generation of thinkers and doers, than by helping them to stand on their feet more firmly, and to give them some hope that they can and will receive their degrees, and they can work towards a future for themselves and their families, and not just a future of paying back debt.”Although the bill was signed on Thursday afternoon in a live press conference, the forgiveness of loans will not begin until the end of 2016 at which point current and former students will begin to see interest and repayment amounts dwindle automatically, eventually leaving everyone with a complete zero-dollar balance.Even while the government has decided to forgive loans from the public sector, private held companies such as Sallie Mae, the leading lender for higher education, still has sky-high interest rates and non-budging repayment schedules. With close to $1 billion in net income every year,  Sallie Mae has stated that they are not interested in following suit with the governments plan for loan forgiveness.“We are a private company, and private lenders. We have no interest in not pursuing every possible avenue to squeeze every penny we can out of our borrowers.” Said Carla Edwarton, CEO of Sallie Mae. “Education is important to us, but paying back your loans are what we care about. We aren’t loan sharks, we aren’t going to break your kneecaps if you don’t pay, as much as we would like to…[But] you can bet we love making all that sweet, sweet high-interest rate cash.”Students who are currently making payments or have defaulted on their loans can expect to receive a packet letter within the next 3 to 4 months detailing how their assistance loans will be forgiven and what percentage, if any, will be left owed to private companies and firms.",1,NewsEmpire
Barack Obama In Blue Suit May Actually Be White President in Gold Suit," WASHINGTON, D.C. –A fearsome debate has broken out on social media across the globe over whether Barack Obama is a black president dressed in blue, or a white president dressed in gold. Obama has long been considered the first black president of America, but is he really?The controversy was sparked by a photo of the president at a gala event in California last weekend. Although more than fifty percent of viewers saw the African American leader in a blue suit, a significant minority insist that he is a white man in a gold suit. YouTube videos attempting to explain the phenomena have gone viral, but which reality is real?“This is a fantastic example of how people’s brains do not interpret sensory input in a uniform way,” said physicist Michael Surewood. “There are many possible explanations for why different individuals see different colors, including the possibility of our minds assuming that the president was standing in shade, that shadows were falling across his outfit, and so on. But what is clear, is that the very identity of our country’s leader is in doubt.”Republican MPs have come out strongly in support of the white and gold rendering of the president, some going so far as to say that the “first African American President line was a simple deception to draw in liberal votes.” Rand Paul, a possible contender for the 2016 presidential elections, is at the forefront of this view.“You can’t tell me what I’m seeing is wrong,” he said to reporters. “I see a white president in a gold suit, and that’s that. Am I meant to believe that my eyes don’t work properly? I’ve been categorizing people by colors all my life. I think I would know when I see a white man.”However, photographs have emerged of the prototype of Barack Obama, showing conclusively a black president in a blue suit. Debate may continue over why Obama looks white to some Americans, but what is sure is that he really is a black man.",1,NewsEmpire
Iran’s Supreme Leader Not a Fan of ‘American Sniper’,"TEHRAN, Iran – Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has spoken out against critically acclaimed film, American Sniper, saying that he is “not a fan.” The screenplay, which portrays a real-life US soldier who killed 160 ‘enemies’, struck a nerve with the spiritual head of the Islamic country.“The dialogue is poorly written, and some of the secondary cast is very poorly chosen,” Khamenei told TMZ. “In addition, the soundtrack does not do the visuals justice.”Some have criticized the film for portraying Islamic people as ‘uncivilised’ and the conflict as ‘simplistic’, but the supreme leader’s criticisms have gone far beyond what he calls “possible thematic inaccuracies”, sparking a feud with director and producer, Clint Eastwood. “What bothers me most is the way the camera angles make the action look contrived, bastardized to resemble any other Hollywood action movie,” he added.Eastwood, who reminded us that he is the man responsible for the highest-grossing war film in history, hit back at Khamenei’s comments, saying, “Who is he to judge? I’ve seen his work. [1991 Iranian drama] Mother totally sucked – yes, it wasn’t Hollywood-ised, and it was gritty and moving, but it hardly had a budget, and some of the actors were clearly amateur and didn’t even speak English!”After half an hour of Googling the Ayatollah’s filmography, we managed to track down the movie in question, and found it to be attributed to Iranian director Ali Hatami, and not Khamenei, to whom Eastwood inaccurately credited it.Iranian President, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, publicly disagreed with the supreme leader, simply saying, “Eastwood is legendary. Don’t f*** with him.”",1,NewsEmpire
Muslim Man Creating Long Lines At TSA Security Check Must be a Member of ISIS,"NEW YORK, New York –Reports emerging from one of the queues at JFK Airport suggest that the Muslim man responsible for the current delay must be a member of ISIS. Although no weapons, flags, or other indications of allegiance to a terror cell can be seen on him, he is being searched for the third time, with contents of his hand luggage being laid out on the desk after passing through the scanner with no clear problems.“I’m almost certain I’ve seen his face before,” says Angela Mason, 45. “He must have been on the news or something. That big beard and turban do not cry innocence.”Other commuters are less certain, but all acquiesce that he must prove his loyalty to America before he is allowed on their flight.“I’m not saying he’s a terrorist or anything,” says businessman Wayne Parnell, 53. “But would you be comfortable sitting next to him on a plane? Nope, didn’t think so.”Sources insist it’s only a matter of time before ISIS or another Islamic extremist group claims responsibility for the delay.“Frankly, I’m surprised we haven’t heard anything from them as yet,” political analyst, Steven Rockstead. “Usually they’re quick to jump on the bandwagon, to increase their publicity and try to display their power. Here, however, no videos admitting guilt have been released online, which may just mean that this obvious terrorist must have something else lined up.”As of press time, officials are allowing the ISIS member to board the plane, although without his shoes, turban, robe or underwear, where he may have been hiding some undetected weapon. His beard and hair have all been shaved off as well, in case he could be carrying a tiny knife in there.",1,NewsEmpire
United States Seeks To Implement 10-Hour Work Week,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – With the presidential nominees slowly starting to become public and we gear up for the 2016 elections, many say that the country is ready to start a new chapter in its history, and that chapter looks to be filled with plenty of vacation time. According to sources, a proposed 10-hour work month is part of the new itinerary of the far-left party that seeks to gain control of the country.According to documents found by media correspondence, every citizen will be asked to work a mandatory 40-hours a month, and no more. Those who violate the law would be punished for excessive profiteering.Government spokesman, Peter Jacobs, spoke proudly as he assured the people of the economic plan. “Greece brought the world democracy, literary tragedies, and universities. There are no bad ideas in Greece. Now, the United States seeks to copy their ideas and bring work down to a minimum, and vacationing to the max, as it was meant to be.”After stocks dropped and sell-offs occurred across the board in New York, President Obama assured the people that things were fine.“The 40-hour work month simply removes those who do not truly understand economics,” said Obama. “With over 700 hours a month to devote to sleeping, eating, drinking, sleeping more, and playing video games, the United States will lead the world in relaxation. There is no price that can be placed on satisfaction and relaxation.”",1,NewsEmpire
